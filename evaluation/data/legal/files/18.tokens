public may be adequately reminded about any health hazards that may be associated with the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages through a nationally uniform nonconfusing warning notice on each container of such beverages and 2 commerce and the national economy may be — A protected to the maximum extent consistent with this declared policy B not impeded by diverse nonuniform and confusing requirements for warnings or other information on alcoholic beverage containers with respect to any relationship between the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages and health and C protected from
