Marketing Quotas — Corn in subpart II heading § 1321 Legislative finding of effect on interstate and foreign commerce and necessity of regulation Corn is a basic source of food for the Nation and corn produced in the commercial corn producing area moves almost wholly in interstate and foreign commerce in the form of corn livestock and livestock products Abnormally excessive and abnormally deficient supplies of corn acutely and directly affect burden and obstruct interstate and foreign commerce in corn livestock and livestock products When abnormally excessive supplies exist transportation facilities in interstate and foreign commerce are overtaxed and the handling and processing facilities through which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce in corn livestock and livestock products is directed become acutely congested Abnormally deficient supplies result in substantial decreases in livestock production and in an inadequate flow of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce with the consequence of unreasonably high prices to consumers Violent fluctuations from year to year in the available supply of corn disrupt the balance between the supply of livestock and livestock products moving in interstate and foreign commerce and the supply of corn available for feeding When available supplies of corn are excessive corn prices are low and farmers overexpand livestock production in order to find outlets for corn Such expansion together with the relative scarcity and high price of corn forces farmers to market abnormally excessive supplies of livestock in interstate commerce at sacrifice prices endangering the financial stability of producers and overtaxing handling and processing facilities through which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce in livestock and livestock products is directed Such excessive marketings deplete livestock on farms and livestock marketed in interstate and foreign commerce consequently becomes abnormally low with resultant high prices to consumers and danger to the financial stability of persons engaged in transporting handling and processing livestock in interstate and foreign commerce These high prices in turn result in another overexpansion of livestock production Recurring violent fluctuations in the price of corn resulting from corresponding violent fluctuations in the supply of corn directly affect the movement of livestock in interstate commerce from the range cattle regions to the regions where livestock is fattened for market in interstate and foreign commerce and also directly affect the movement in interstate commerce of corn marketed as corn which is transported from the regions where produced to the regions where livestock is fattened for market in interstate and foreign commerce Substantially all the corn moving in interstate commerce substantially all the corn fed to livestock transported in interstate commerce for fattening and substantially all the corn fed to livestock marketed in interstate and foreign commerce is produced in the commercial corn producing area Substantially all the corn produced in the commercial corn producing area with the exception of a comparatively small amount used for farm consumption is either sold or transported in interstate commerce or is fed to livestock transported in interstate commerce for feeding or is fed to livestock marketed in interstate and foreign commerce Almost all the corn produced outside the commercial corn producing area is either consumed or is fed to livestock which is consumed in the State in which such corn is produced The conditions affecting the production and marketing of corn and the livestock products of corn are such that without Federal assistance farmers individually or in cooperation cannot effectively prevent the recurrence of disparities between the supplies of livestock moving in interstate and foreign commerce and the supply of corn available for feeding and provide for orderly marketing of corn in interstate and foreign commerce and livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce The national public interest requires that the burdens on interstate and foreign commerce above described be removed by the exercise of Federal power By reason of the administrative and physical impracticability of regulating the movement of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce and the inadequacy of any such regulation to remove such burdens such power can be feasibly exercised only by providing for the withholding from market of excessive and burdensome supplies of corn in times of excessive production and providing a reserve supply of corn available for market in times of deficient production in order that a stable and continuous flow of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce may at all times be assured and maintained Feb 16 1938 ch 30 title III § 321 52 Stat 48 Inapplicability of

marketing penalty for cotton and rice crop loans on cotton corn wheat rice tobacco and peanuts but was amended generally in 1954 to make it inapplicable to corn See section 1340 of this title Section was not enacted as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 which comprises this chapter subpart iii — marketing quotas — wheat § 1331 Legislative finding of effect on interstate and foreign commerce and necessity of regulation Wheat is a basic source of food for the Nation is produced throughout the United States by more than a million farmers is sold on the country wide market and as wheat or flour flows almost entirely through instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce from producers to consumers Abnormally excessive and abnormally deficient supplies of wheat on the country wide market acutely and directly affect burden and obstruct interstate and foreign commerce Abnormally excessive supplies overtax the facilities of interstate and foreign transportation congest terminal markets and milling centers in the flow of wheat from producers to consumers depress the price of wheat in interstate and foreign commerce and otherwise disrupt the orderly marketing of such commodity in such commerce Abnormally deficient supplies result in an inadequate flow of wheat and its products in interstate and foreign commerce with consequent injurious effects to the instrumentalities of such commerce and with excessive increases in the prices of wheat and its products in interstate and foreign commerce It is in the interest of the general welfare that interstate and foreign commerce in wheat and its products be protected from such burdensome surpluses and distressing shortages and that a supply of wheat be maintained which is adequate to meet domestic consumption and export requirements in years of drought flood and other adverse conditions as well as in years of plenty and that the soil resources of the Nation be not wasted in the production of such burdensome surpluses Such surpluses result in disastrously low prices of wheat and other grains to wheat producers destroy the purchasing power of grain producers for industrial products and reduce the value of the agricultural assets supporting the national credit structure Such shortages of wheat result in unreasonably high prices of flour and bread to consumers and loss of market outlets by wheat producers The conditions affecting the production and marketing of wheat are such that without Federal assistance farmers individually or in cooperation cannot effectively prevent the recurrence of such surpluses and shortages and the burdens on interstate and foreign commerce resulting therefrom maintain normal supplies of wheat or provide for the orderly marketing thereof in interstate and foreign commerce Wheat which is planted and not disposed of prior to the date prescribed by the Secretary for the disposal of excess acres of wheat is an addition to the total supply of wheat and has a direct effect on the price of wheat in interstate and foreign commerce and may also affect the supply and price of livestock and livestock products In the circumstances wheat not disposed of prior to such date must be considered in the same manner as mechanically harvested wheat in order to achieve the policy of the chapter The diversion of substantial acreages from wheat to the production of commodities which are in surplus supply or which will be in surplus supply if they are permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage would burden obstruct and adversely affect interstate and foreign commerce in such commodities and would adversely affect the prices of such commodities in interstate and foreign commerce Small changes in the supply of a commodity could create a sufficient surplus to affect seriously the price of such commodity in interstate and foreign commerce Large changes in the supply of such commodity could have a more acute effect on the price of the commodity in interstate and foreign commerce and also could overtax the handling processing and transportation facilities through which the flow of interstate and foreign commerce in such commodity is directed Such adverse effects caused by overproduction in one year could further result in a deficient supply of the commodity in the succeeding year causing excessive increases in the price of the commodity in interstate and foreign commerce in such year It is therefore necessary to prevent acreage diverted from the production of wheat to be used to produce commodities which are in surplus supply or which will be in surplus supply if they are permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage The provisions of this subpart affording a cooperative plan to wheat producers are necessary in order to minimize recurring surpluses and shortages of wheat in interstate and foreign commerce to provide for the maintenance of adequate reserve supplies thereof to provide for an adequate and orderly flow of wheat and its products in interstate and foreign commerce at prices which are fair and reasonable to farmers and consumers and to prevent acreage diverted from the production of wheat from adversely affecting other commodities in interstate and foreign commerce Feb 16 1938 ch 30 title III § 331 52 Stat 52 Pub L 87 – 703 title III § 310 Sept 27 1962 76 Stat 618 Amendments 1962 — Pub

the necessity of a cooperative plan to wheat producers to provide for flow of wheat at fair and reasonable prices to farmers and consumers and to prevent diverted acreage from production of wheat from

and less the special acreage reserve provided for in this subsection shall be apportioned by the Secretary among the States on the basis of the preceding year s allotment for each such State including all amounts allotted to the State and including for 1967 the increased acreage in the State allotted for 1966 under section 1335 of this title adjusted to the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary to establish a fair and equitable apportionment base for each State taking into consideration established crop rotation practices estimated decrease in farm allotments because of loss of history and other relevant factors The reserve acreage set aside herein for apportionment by the Secretary shall be used 1 to make allotments to counties in addition to the county allotments made under subsection b of this section on the basis of the relative needs of counties for additional allotments because of reclamation and other new areas coming into production of wheat or 2 to increase the allotment for any county in which wheat is the principal grain crop produced on the basis of its relative need for such increase if the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms in such county is less by at least 20 per centum than such average ratio on old wheat farms in an adjoining county or counties in which wheat is the principal grain crop produced or if there is a definable contiguous area consisting of at least 10 per centum of the cropland acreage in such county in which the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms is less by at least 20 per centum than such average ratio on the remaining old wheat farms in such county provided that such low ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland is due to the shift prior to 1951 from wheat to one or more alternative income producing crops which because of plant disease or sustained loss of markets may no longer be produced at a fair profit and there is no other alternative income producing crop suitable for production in the area or county The increase in the county allotment under clause 2 of the preceding sentence shall be used to increase allotments for old wheat farms in the affected area to make such allotments comparable with those on similar farms in adjoining areas or counties but the average ratio of increased allotments to cropland on such farms shall not exceed the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms in the adjoining areas or counties There also shall be made available a special acreage reserve of not in excess of one million acres as determined by the Secretary to be desirable for the purposes hereof which shall be in addition to the national acreage reserve provided for in this subsection Such special acreage reserve shall be made available to the States to make additional allotments to counties on the basis of the relative needs of counties as determined by the Secretary for additional allotments to make adjustments in the allotments on old wheat farms that is farms on which wheat has been seeded or regarded as seeded to one or more of the three crops immediately preceding the crop for which the allotment is established on which the ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on the farm is less than one half the average ratio of wheat acreage allotment to cropland on old wheat farms in the county Such adjustments shall not provide an allotment for any farm which would result in an allotment cropland ratio for the farm in excess of one half of such county average ratio and the total of such adjustments in any county shall not exceed the acreage made available therefor in the county Such apportionment from the special acreage reserve shall be made only to counties where wheat is a major income producing crop only to farms on which there is limited opportunity for the production of an alternative income producing crop and only if an efficient farming operation on the farm requires the allotment of additional acreage from the special acreage reserve For the purposes of making adjustments hereunder the cropland on the farm shall not include any land developed as cropland subsequent to the 1963 crop year b Apportionment among counties The State acreage allotment for wheat less a reserve of not to exceed 3 per centum thereof for apportionment as provided in subsection c of this section shall be apportioned by the Secretary among the counties in the State on the basis of the preceding year s wheat allotment in each such county including for 1967 the increased acreage in the county allotted for 1966 pursuant to section 1335 of this title adjusted to the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary in order to establish a fair and equitable apportionment base for each county taking into consideration established crop rotation practices estimated decrease in farm allotments because of loss of history and other relevant factors c Apportionment among farms overplanted allotments reductions notice 1 The allotment to the county shall be apportioned by the Secretary through the local committees among the farms within the county on the basis of past acreage of wheat tillable acres crop rotation practices type of soil and topography Not more than 3 per centum of the State allotment shall be apportioned to farms on which wheat has not been planted during any of the three marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year in which the allotment is made For the purpose of establishing farm acreage allotments — i the past acreage of wheat on any farm for 1958 or 1965 shall be the base acreage determined for the farm under the regulations issued by the Secretary for determining 1958 or 1965 farm wheat acreage allotments ii if subsequent to the determination of such base acreage the 1958 or 1965 wheat acreage allotment for the farm is increased through administrative review or court proceedings the 1958 or 1965 farm base acreage shall be increased in the same proportion and iii the past acreage of wheat for 1959 and any subsequent year except 1965 shall be the wheat acreage on the farm which is not in excess of the farm wheat acreage allotment plus in the case wheat acreage on the farm which is not in excess of wheat acreage allotment the acreage diverted under such wheat allotment programs Provided That for 1959 and subsequent years in the case of any farm on which the entire amount of the farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary or stored in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty the past acreage of wheat for the year in which such farm marketing excess is so delivered or stored shall be the farm base acreage of wheat determined for the farm under the regulations issued by the Secretary for determining farm wheat acreage allotments for such year but if any part of the amount of wheat so stored is later depleted and penalty becomes due by reason of such depletion for the purpose of establishing farm wheat acreage allotments subsequent to such depletion the past acreage of wheat for the farm for the year in which the excess was produced shall be reduced to the farm wheat acreage allotment for such year 2 Notwithstanding any other provision of law each old or new farm acreage allotment for the 1962 crop of wheat as determined on the basis of a minimum national acreage allotment of fifty five million acres shall be reduced by 10 per centum In the event notices of farm acreage allotments for the 1962 crop of wheat have been mailed to farm operators prior to the effective date of this subparagraph 2 new notices showing the required reduction shall be mailed to farm operators as soon as practicable 3 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection the past acreage of wheat for 1967 and any subsequent year shall be the acreage of wheat planted plus the acreage regarded as planted for harvest as grain on the farm which is not in excess of the farm acreage allotment 4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection c the farm acreage allotment for the 1967 and any subsequent crop of wheat shall be established for each old farm by apportioning the county wheat acreage allotment among farms in the county on which wheat has been planted or is considered to have been planted for harvest as grain in any one of the three years immediately preceding the year for which allotments are determined on the basis of past acreage of wheat and the farm acreage allotment for the year immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is being established adjusted as hereinafter provided For purposes of this paragraph the acreage allotment for the immediately preceding year may be adjusted to reflect established crop rotation practices may be adjusted downward to reflect a reduction in the tillable acreage on the farm and may be adjusted upward to reflect such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered for the purpose of establishing a fair and equitable allotment Provided That i for the purposes of computing the allotment for any year the acreage allotment for the farm for the immediately preceding year shall be decreased by 7 per centum if for the year immediately preceding the year for which such reduction is made neither a voluntary diversion program nor a voluntary certificate program was in effect and there was noncompliance with the farm acreage allotment for such year ii for purposes of clause i any farm on which the entire amount of farm marketing excess is delivered to the Secretary stored or adjusted to zero in accordance with applicable regulations to avoid or postpone payment of the penalty when farm marketing quotas are in effect shall be considered in compliance with the allotment but if any part of the amount of wheat so stored is later depleted and penalty becomes due by reason of such depletion the allotment for such farm next computed after determination of such depletion shall be reduced by reducing the allotment for the immediately preceding year by 7 per centum and iii for purposes of clause i if the Secretary determines that the reduction in the allotment does not provide fair and equitable treatment to producers on farms following special crop rotation practices he may modify such reduction in the allotment as he determines to be necessary to provide fair and equitable treatment to such producers d Repealed Pub L 89 – 321 title V § 501 6 Nov 3 1965 79 Stat 1201 e Increase in acreage allotments and marketing quotas for class II durum wheat If with respect to the 1962 and 1963 crops of wheat the Secretary determines that the acreage allotments of farms producing durum wheat are inadequate to provide for the production of a sufficient quantity of durum wheat to satisfy the demands therefor but not including export demand involving a subsidy by or a loss to the Federal Government he shall increase the farm marketing quotas and acreage allotments for such crop of wheat for farms located in counties in the States of North Dakota Minnesota Montana South Dakota and California designated by the Secretary as counties which 1 are capable of producing durum wheat class II and 2 have produced such wheat for commercial food products during one or more of the five years immediately preceding the year in which such crop is harvested The Secretary shall determine the percentage factor by which the average acreage of durum wheat class II produced during the last two year period for which statistics are available excluding any increases in durum wheat acreage as a result of increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection must be increased to satisfy such demand The wheat acreage allotment for any farm established for such crop without regard to this subsection after reduction in the case of the 1962 crop as required by subsection c 2 hereinafter referred to as the original allotment shall be increased by an acreage computed by multiplying the average acreage of durum wheat class II on the farm during such two year period excluding any increase in the acreage of durum wheat as a result of an increase in the wheat acreage allotment for the farm authorized by this subsection by such percentage factor Provided That such increased allotment shall not exceed the cropland on the farm well suited to wheat The increase in the wheat acreage allotment for any farm shall be conditioned upon the production of an acreage of durum wheat class II at least equal to the average acreage of such wheat produced during such two year period plus the number of acres by which the allotment is increased Any increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to the National State and county wheat acreage allotments and such increases shall not be considered in establishing future State county and farm allotments The provisions of sections 1326 b and 1340 6 of this title relating to the reduction of the storage amount of wheat shall apply to the allotment for the farm established without regard to this subsection and not to the increased allotment under this subsection As used in this subsection the term durum wheat means durum wheat class II other than the varieties known as Golden Ball and Peliss Any farm receiving an increased allotment under this subsection shall not be required as a condition of eligibility for price support or permitted to participate in the special 1962 wheat program formulated under section 124 of the Agricultural Act of 1961 or section 307 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962 The Secretary shall give growers and millers of durum wheat and manufacturers of semolina products an opportunity to present their views and recommendations prior to making any determination hereunder f Voluntary surrender of acreage allotment Any part of any 1955 1956 or 1957 farm wheat acreage allotment on which wheat will not be planted and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotment to such farm and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of past acreage of wheat tillable acres crop rotation practices type of soil and topography If all of the allotted acreage voluntarily surrendered is not needed in the county the county committee may surrender the excess acreage to the State committee to be used for the same purposes as the State acreage reserve under subsection c of this section Any allotment transferred under this provision shall be regarded for the purposes of subsection c of this section as having been planted on the farm from which transferred rather than on the farm to which transferred except that this shall not operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having wheat planted thereon during the three year base period Provided That notwithstanding any other provisions of law any part of any 1955 1956 or 1957 farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm and reapportioned as provided herein Acreage surrendered reapportioned under this subsection and planted shall be credited to the State and county in determining future acreage allotments g Plantings in excess of allotments or where no allotment is established Notwithstanding any other provision of law no acreage in the commercial wheat producing area seeded to wheat for harvest as grain in 1958 or thereafter except 1965 in excess of acreage allotments shall be considered in establishing future State and county acreage allotments The planting on a farm in the commercial wheat producing area of wheat of the 1958 or any subsequent crop for which no farm wheat acreage allotment was established shall not make the farm eligible for an allotment as an old farm pursuant to the first sentence of subsection c of this section nor shall such farm by reason of such planting be considered ineligible for an allotment as a new farm under the second sentence of such subsection h Omitted i Increase in acreage allotments for any kind of wheat in short supply storage reduction and land use provisions inapplicable to such wheat If with respect to any crop of wheat the Secretary finds that the acreage allotments of farms producing any type of wheat are inadequate to provide for the production of a sufficient quantity of such type of wheat to satisfy the demand therefor the wheat acreage allotment for such crop for each farm located in a county designated by the Secretary as a county which 1 is capable of producing such type of wheat and 2 has produced such type of wheat for commercial food products during one or more of the five years immediately preceding the year in which such crop is harvested shall be increased by such uniform percentage as he deems necessary to provide for such quantity No increase shall be made under this subsection in the wheat acreage allotment of any farm for any crop if any wheat other than such type of wheat is planted on such farm for such crop Any increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to the National State and county wheat acreage allotments and such increases shall not be considered in establishing future State county and farm allotments The provisions of sections 1326 b and 1340 6 of this title relating to the reduction of the storage amount of wheat shall apply to the allotment for the farm established without regard to this subsection and not to the increased allotment under this subsection The land use provisions of section 1339 of this title shall not be applicable to any farm receiving an increased allotment under this subsection and the producers on such farms shall not be required to comply with such provisions as a condition of eligibility for price support j Increased durum wheat acreage allotments to Tulelake area California for 1970 and subsequent years factors determinative effect of increased allotments on marketing allocations and diversion payments Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter the Secretary shall increase the acreage allotments for the 1970 and subsequent crops of wheat for privately owned farms in the irrigable portion of the area known as the Tulelake division of the Klamath project of California located in Modoc and Siskiyou Counties California as defined by the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation and hereinafter referred to as the area The increase for the area for each such crop shall be determined by adding to the extent applications are made therefor to the total allotments established for privately owned farms in the area for the particular crop without regard to this subsection hereinafter referred to as the original allotments an acreage sufficient to make available for each such crop a total allotment of twelve thousand acres for the area The additional allotments made available by this subsection shall be in addition to the National State and county allotments otherwise established under this section and the acreage planted to wheat pursuant to such increases in allotments shall not be taken into account in establishing future State county and farm acreage allotments except as may be desirable in providing increases in allotments for subsequent years under this subsection for the production of Durum wheat The Secretary shall apportion the additional allotment acreage made available under this subsection between Modoc and Siskiyou Counties on the basis of the relative needs for additional allotments for the portion of the area in each county The Secretary shall allot such additional acreage to individual farms in the area for which applications for increased acreages are made on the basis of tillable acres crop rotation practices type of soil and topography and the original allotment for the farm if any The increase in the wheat acreage allotment for any farm under this subsection 1 shall not be taken into account in computing the farm wheat marketing allocation under section 1379b of this title and 2 shall be conditioned upon the production of Durum wheat on the original allotment and on the increased acreage The producers on a farm receiving an increased allotment under this subsection shall not be eligible for diversion payments under section 1339 of this title k Transfer of farm wheat acreage allotments in case of natural disasters Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter if the Secretary determines that because of a natural disaster a portion of the farm wheat acreage allotments in a county cannot be timely planted or replanted he may authorize the transfer of all or a part of the wheat acreage allotment for any farm in the county so affected to another farm in the county or in an adjoining county on which one or more of the producers on the farm from which the transfer is to be made will be engaged in the production of wheat and will share in the proceeds thereof in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe Any farm

The farm marketing quota for any crop of wheat shall be the actual production of the acreage planted to such crop of wheat on the farm less the farm marketing excess The farm marketing excess shall be an amount equal to twice the projected farm yield multiplied by the number of acres of such crop of wheat on the farm in excess of the farm acreage allotment for such crop unless the producer in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary and within the time prescribed therein establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary the actual production of such crop of wheat on the farm If such actual production is so established the farm marketing excess shall be an amount equal to the actual production of the number of acres of wheat on the farm in excess of the farm acreage allotment for such crop In determining the farm marketing quota and farm marketing excess any acreage of wheat remaining after the date prescribed by the Secretary for the disposal of excess acres of wheat shall be included as acreage of wheat on the farm and the production thereof shall be appraised in such manner as the Secretary determines will provide a reasonably accurate estimate of such production Any acreage of wheat disposed of in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary prior to such date as may be prescribed by the Secretary shall be excluded in determining the farm marketing quota and farm marketing excess Self seeded volunteer wheat shall be included in determining the acreage of wheat Marketing quotas for any marketing year shall be in effect with respect to wheat harvested in the calendar year in which such marketing year begins notwithstanding that the wheat is marketed prior to the beginning of such marketing year 2 Whenever farm marketing quotas are in effect with respect to any crop of wheat the producers on a farm shall be subject to a penalty on the farm marketing excess of wheat at a rate per bushel equal to 65 per centum of the parity price per bushel of wheat as of May 1 of the calendar year in which the crop is harvested Each producer having an interest in the crop of wheat on any farm for which a farm marketing excess of wheat is determined shall be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the penalty on the farm marketing excess 3 The farm marketing excess for wheat shall be regarded as available for marketing and the penalty and the storage amount or amounts to be delivered to the Secretary of the commodity shall be computed upon twice the normal production of the excess acreage Where upon the application of the producer for an adjustment of penalty or of storage it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the actual production of the excess acreage is less than twice the normal production thereof the difference between the amount of the penalty or storage as computed upon the basis of twice the normal production and as computed upon the basis of actual production shall be returned to or allowed the producer The Secretary shall issue regulations under which the farm marketing excess of the commodity for the farm may be stored or delivered to him Upon failure to store or deliver to the Secretary the farm marketing excess within such time as may be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary the penalty computed as aforesaid shall be paid by the producer Any wheat delivered to the Secretary hereunder shall become the property of the United States and shall be disposed of by the Secretary for relief purposes in the United States or in foreign countries or in such other manner as he shall determine will divert it from the normal channels of trade and commerce 4 Until the producers on any farm store deliver to the Secretary or pay the penalty on the farm marketing excess of any crop of wheat the entire crop of wheat produced on the farm and any subsequent crop of wheat subject to marketing quotas in which the producer has an interest shall be subject to a lien in favor of the United States for the amount of the penalty 5 The penalty upon wheat stored shall be paid by the producer at the time and to the extent of any depletion in the amount of the commodity so stored except depletion resulting from some cause beyond the control of the producer 6 Whenever the planted acreage of the then current crop of wheat on any farm is less than the farm acreage allotment for such commodity the total amount of the commodity from any previous crops required to be stored in order to postpone or avoid payment of penalty shall be reduced by that amount which is equal to the normal production of the number of acres by which the farm acreage allotment exceeds the planted acreage The provisions of section 1326 b and c of this title shall be applicable also to wheat 7 Until the farm marketing excess of wheat is stored or delivered to the Secretary or the penalty thereon is paid each bushel of the commodity produced on the farm which is sold by the producer to any person within the United States shall be subject to the penalty as specified in paragraph 2 of this section Such penalty shall be paid by the buyer who may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid to the producer If the buyer fails to collect such penalty such buyer and all persons entitled to share in the wheat marketed from the farm or the proceeds thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for such penalty 8 The marketing penalty for rice produced in the calendar year in which any marketing year begins if beginning with or after the 1941 – 1942

Legislative findings American cotton is a basic source of clothing and industrial products used by every person in the United States and by substantial numbers of people in foreign countries American cotton is sold on a world wide market and moves from the places of production almost entirely in interstate and foreign commerce to processing establishments located throughout the world at places outside the State where the cotton is produced Fluctuations in supplies of cotton and the marketing of excessive supplies of cotton in interstate and foreign commerce disrupt the orderly marketing of cotton in such commerce with consequent injury to and destruction of such commerce Excessive supplies of cotton directly and materially affect the volume of cotton moving in interstate and foreign commerce and cause disparity in prices of cotton and industrial products moving in interstate and foreign commerce with consequent diminution of the volume of such commerce in industrial products The conditions affecting the production and marketing of cotton are such that without Federal assistance farmers individually or in cooperation cannot effectively prevent the recurrence of excessive supplies of cotton and fluctuations in supplies cannot prevent indiscriminate dumping of excessive supplies on the Nation wide and foreign markets cannot maintain normal carry overs of cotton and cannot provide for the orderly marketing of cotton in interstate and foreign commerce It is in the interest of the general welfare that interstate and foreign commerce in cotton be protected from the burdens caused by the marketing of excessive supplies of cotton in such commerce that a supply of cotton be maintained which is adequate to meet domestic consumption and export requirements in years of drought flood and other adverse conditions as well as in years of plenty and that the soil resources of the Nation be not wasted in the production of excessive supplies of cotton The provisions of this subpart affording a cooperative plan to cotton producers are necessary and appropriate to prevent the burdens on interstate and foreign commerce caused by the marketing in such commerce of excessive supplies and to promote foster and maintain an orderly flow of an adequate supply of cotton in such commerce Feb 16 1938 ch 30 title III § 341 52 Stat 55 Inapplicability of Section Section

the crop of cotton produced in the next calendar year The Secretary shall also determine and specify in such proclamation the amount of the national marketing quota in terms of the number of bales of cotton standard bales of five hundred pounds gross weight adequate together with 1 the estimated carry over at the beginning of the marketing year which begins in the next calendar year and 2 the estimated imports during such marketing year to make available a normal supply of cotton Provided That beginning with the 1961 crop the national marketing quota shall be not less than a number of bales equal to the estimated domestic consumption and estimated exports less estimated imports for the marketing year for which the quota is proclaimed except that the Secretary shall make such adjustment in the amount of such quota as he determines necessary after taking into consideration the estimated stocks of cotton in the United States including the qualities of such stocks and stocks in foreign countries which would be available for the marketing year for which the quota is being proclaimed if no adjustment of such quota is made hereunder to assure the maintenance of adequate but not excessive stocks in the United States to provide a continuous and stable supply of the different qualities of cotton needed in the United States and in foreign cotton consuming countries and for purposes of national security but the Secretary in making such adjustments may not reduce the national marketing quota for any year below i one million bales less than the estimated domestic consumption and estimated exports for the marketing year for which such quota is being proclaimed or ii ten million bales whichever is larger Such proclamation shall be made not later than October 15 of the calendar year in which such determination is made Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section the national marketing quota for cotton for 1957 and 1958 shall be not less than the

acreage reserve The national acreage allotment for cotton for 1953 and subsequent years shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of the acreage planted to cotton including the acreage regarded as having been planted to cotton under the provisions of Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress during the five calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the national marketing quota is proclaimed with adjustments for abnormal weather conditions during such period Provided That there is established a national acreage reserve consisting of three hundred and ten thousand acres which shall be in addition to the national acreage allotment and such reserve shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of their needs for additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments under subsection f 1 as determined by the Secretary without regard to State and county acreage reserves except that the amount apportioned to Nevada shall be one thousand acres For the 1960 and succeeding crops of cotton the needs of States other than Nevada for such additional acreage for such purpose may be estimated by the Secretary after taking into consideration such needs as determined or estimated for the preceding crop of cotton and the size of the national acreage allotment for such crop The additional acreage so apportioned to the State shall be apportioned to the counties on the basis of the needs of the counties for such additional acreage for such purpose and added to the county acreage allotment for apportionment to farms pursuant to subsection f of this section except that no part of such additional acreage shall be used to increase the county reserve above 15 per centum of the county allotment determined without regard to such additional acreage Additional acreage apportioned to a State for any year under the foregoing proviso shall not be taken into account in establishing future State acreage allotments Needs for additional acreage under the foregoing provisions and under the last proviso in subsection e shall be determined or estimated as though allotments were first computed without regard to subsection f 1 c Apportionment among

allotment base of twenty two million five hundred thousand acres computed and adjusted as follows 1 The average of the planted acreages including acreage regarded as planted under the provisions of Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress in the States for the years 1945 1946 1947 and 1948 shall constitute the national base except that in the case of any State having a 1948 planted cotton acreage of over one million acres and less than 50 per centum of the 1943 allotment the average of the acreage planted or regarded as planted under Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress for the years 1944 1945 1946 1947 and 1948 shall constitute the base for such State and shall be included in computing the national base to this is to be added A the estimated additional acreage for each State required for small farm allotments under subsection f 1 of this section B the acreage required as a result of the State adjustment provisions of paragraph 2 of this subsection C the additional acreage required to determine a total national allotment base of twenty two million five hundred thousand acres which additional acreage shall be distributed on a proportionate basis among States receiving no adjustment under paragraph 2 of this subsection 2 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection the acreage allotment base for 1950 and 1951 for any State on the basis of a national acreage allotment base of twenty two million five hundred thousand acres shall not be less than the larger of 1 95 per centum of the average acreage actually planted to cotton in the State during the years 1947 and 1948 or 2 85 per centum of the acreage planted to cotton in the State in 1948 3 If the national acreage allotment for 1950 or 1951 is more or less than twenty two million five hundred thousand acres horizontal adjustments shall be made percentagewise by States so as to reflect the ratio of the national acreage allotment for 1950 and 1951 to twenty two million five hundred thousand acres d Apportionment for year 1952 adjustment The national acreage allotment for cotton for 1952 shall be apportioned to States on the basis of the acreage planted to cotton including the acreage regarded as having been planted to cotton under the provisions of Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress during the years 1946 1947 1948 and 1950 with adjustments for abnormal weather conditions during such period e Apportionment among counties reservation of acreage additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments The State acreage allotment for cotton shall be apportioned to counties on the same basis as to years and conditions as is applicable to the State under subsections b c and d of this section Provided That the State committee may reserve not to exceed 10 per centum of its State acreage allotment 15 per centum if the State s 1948 planted acreage was in excess of one million acres and less than half its 1943 allotment which shall be used to make adjustments in county allotments for trends in acreage for counties adversely affected by abnormal conditions affecting plantings or for small or new farms or to correct inequities in farm allotments and to prevent hardship Provided further That if the additional acreage allocated to a State under the proviso in subsection b is less than the requirements as determined or estimated by the Secretary for establishing minimum farm allotments for the State under subsection f 1 the acreage reserved under this subsection shall not be less than the smaller of 1 the remaining acreage so determined or estimated to be required for establishing minimum farm allotments or 2 3 per centum of the State acreage allotment and the acreage which is required to be reserved under this proviso shall be allocated to counties on the basis of their needs for additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments under subsection f 1 and added to the county acreage allotment for apportionment to farms pursuant to subsection f of this section except that no part of such additional acreage shall be used to increase the county reserve above 15 per centum of the county allotment determined without regard to such additional acreages f Apportionment among farms The county acreage allotment less not to exceed the percentage provided for in paragraph 3 of this subsection shall be apportioned to farms on which cotton has been planted or regarded as having been planted under the provisions of Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress in any one of the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined on the following basis 1 Insofar as such acreage is available there shall be allotted the smaller of the following A ten acres or B the acreage allotment established for the farm for the 1958 crop 2 The remainder shall be allotted to farms other than farms to which an allotment has been made under paragraph 1 B of this subsection so that the allotment to each farm under this paragraph together with the amount of the allotment to such farm under paragraph 1 A of this subsection shall be a prescribed percentage which percentage shall be the same for all such farms in the county or administrative area of the acreage during the preceding year on the farm which is tilled annually or in regular rotation excluding from such acreages the acres devoted to the production of sugarcane for sugar sugar beets for sugar wheat tobacco or rice for market peanuts picked and threshed wheat or rice for feeding to livestock for market or lands determined to be devoted primarily to orchards or vineyards and nonirrigated lands in irrigated areas Provided however That if a farm would be allotted under this paragraph an acreage

Congress to cotton during any of the preceding three years the acreage allotment for such farm shall not exceed such largest acreage so planted and regarded as planted under Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress in any such year 3 The county committee may reserve not in excess of 15 per centum of the county allotment 15 per centum if the State s 1948 planted cotton acreage was in excess of one million acres and less than half its 1943 allotment which in addition to the acreage made available under the proviso in subsection e shall be used for A establishing allotments for farms on which cotton was not planted or regarded as planted under Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress during any of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is made on the basis of land labor and equipment available for the production of cotton crop rotation practices and the soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton and B making adjustments of the farm acreage allotments established under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection so as to establish allotments which are fair and reasonable in relation to the factors set forth in this paragraph and abnormal conditions of production on such farms or in making adjustments in farm acreage allotments to correct inequities and to prevent hardship Provided That not less than 20 per centum of the acreage reserved under this subsection shall to the extent required be allotted upon such basis as the Secretary deems fair and reasonable to farms other than farms to which an allotment has been made under paragraph 1 B of this subsection if any to which an allotment of not exceeding fifteen acres may be made under other provisions of this subsection 4 Any part of the acreage allotted for 1950 to individual farms in any county under the provisions of this section which will not be planted to cotton and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotments to such farms and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments to the extent necessary to provide such farms with the allotments authorized under paragraph 5 of this subsection If any acreage remains after providing such allotments it may be apportioned in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable to other farms in the same county receiving allotments which the county committee determines are inadequate and not representative in view of their past production of cotton and to new farms in such county No allotment shall be made or increased by reason of this paragraph to an acreage in excess of 40 per centum of the acreage on the farm which is tilled annually or in regular rotation as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary Any transfer of allotment under this paragraph shall not operate to reduce the allotment for any subsequent year for the farm from which acreage is transferred except in accordance with paragraph 1 B and the proviso in paragraph 2 of this subsection Provided That any part of any farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm and may be reapportioned in the manner set forth above In any subsequent year unless hereafter otherwise provided by law

planted to cotton under the provisions of Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress on the farm in 1946 1947 and 1948 or 45 per centum of the highest acreage planted to cotton or regarded as planted to cotton under Public Law 12 Seventy ninth Congress on the farm in any one of such three years but no such allotment shall be increased by reason of this provision to an acreage in excess of 40 per centum of the acreage on the farm which is tilled annually or in regular rotation as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary An increase in any 1950 farm acreage allotment shall be made pursuant to this paragraph only upon application in writing by the owner or operator of the farm within such reasonable period of time in no event less than fifteen days as may be prescribed by the Secretary The additional acreage required to be allotted to farms under this paragraph shall be in addition to the county State and national acreage allotments and the production from such acreage shall be in addition to the national marketing quota The additional acreage authorized by this paragraph shall not be taken into account in establishing future State county and farm acreage allotments 6 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of the subsection if the county committee recommends such action and the Secretary determines that such action will result in a more equitable distribution of the county allotment among farms in the county the remainder of the county acreage allotment after making allotments as provided in paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be allotted to farms other than farms to which an allotment has been made under paragraph 1 B of this subsection so that the allotment to each farm under this paragraph together with the amount of the allotment of such farm under paragraph 1 A of this subsection shall be a prescribed percentage which percentage shall be the same for all such farms in the county of the average acreage planted to cotton on the farm during the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined adjusted as may be necessary for abnormal conditions affecting plantings during such three year period Provided That the county committee may in its discretion limit any farm acreage allotment established under the provisions of this paragraph for any year to an acreage not in excess of 50 per centum of the cropland on the farm as determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this subsection Provided further That any part of the county acreage allotment not apportioned under this paragraph by reason of the initial application of such 50 per centum limitation shall be added to the county acreage reserve under paragraph 3 of this subsection and shall be available for the purposes specified therein If the county acreage allotment is apportioned among the farms of the county in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph the acreage reserved under paragraph 3 of this subsection may be used to make adjustments so as to establish allotments which are fair and reasonable to farms receiving allotments under this paragraph in relation to the factors set forth in paragraph 3 of this subsection 7 A In the event that any farm acreage allotment is less than that prescribed by paragraph 1 of this subsection such acreage allotment shall be increased to the acreage prescribed by said paragraph 1 The additional acreage required to be allotted to farms under this paragraph shall be in addition to the county State and national acreage allotments and the production from such acreage shall be in addition to the national marketing quota B Notwithstanding any other provision of law — i the acreage by which any farm acreage allotment for 1959 or any subsequent crop

to other farms in the county under paragraph 2 6 or 8 of this subsection shall not be taken into account in establishing the acreage allotment for such farm for any crop for which acreage is allotted to such farm under paragraph 2 6 or 8 of this subsection and acreage shall be allotted under paragraph 2 6 or 8 of this subsection to farms which did not receive 1958 crop allotments in excess of ten acres if and only if the Secretary determines after considering the allotments to other farms in the county for such crop compared with their 1958 allotments and other relevant factors that equity and justice require the allotment of additional acreage to such farm under paragraph 2 6 or 8 of this subsection ii the acreage by which any county acreage allotment for 1959 or any subsequent crop is increased from the national or State reserve on the basis of its needs for additional acreage for establishing minimum farm allotments shall not be taken into account in establishing future county acreage allotments and iii the additional acreage allotted pursuant to subparagraph A of this paragraph 7 shall not be taken into account in establishing future State county or farm acreage allotments 8 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of paragraphs 2 and 6 of this subsection the Secretary shall if allotments were in effect the preceding year provide for the county acreage allotment for the 1959 and succeeding crops of cotton less the acreage reserved under paragraph 3 of this subsection to be apportioned to farms on which cotton has been planted in any one of the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined on the basis of the farm acreage allotment for the year immediately preceding the year for which such apportionment is made adjusted as may be necessary i for any change in the acreage of cropland available for the production of cotton or ii to meet the requirements of any provision other than those contained in paragraphs 2 and 6 with respect to the counting of acreage for history purposes Provided That beginning with allotments established for the 1961 crop of cotton if the acreage actually planted or regarded as planted under the

whichever is smaller in lieu of using such allotment as the farm base as provided in this paragraph the base shall be the average of 1 the cotton acreage for the farm for the preceding year as determined for purposes of this proviso and 2 the allotment established for the farm pursuant to the provisions of this subsection for such preceding year and the 1958 allotment used for establishing the minimum farm allotment under paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be adjusted to the average acreage so determined The base for a farm shall not be adjusted as provided in this paragraph if the county committee determines that failure to plant at least 75 per centum of the farm allotment was due to conditions beyond the control of producers on the farm The Secretary shall establish limitations to prevent allocations of allotment to farms not affected by the foregoing proviso which would be excessive on the basis of the cropland past cotton acreage allotments for other commodities and good soil conservation practices on such farms g Law and conditions governing establishment of acreage allotments and yields Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section — 1 State county and farm acreage allotments and yields for cotton shall be established in conformity with section 1344a of this title 2 In apportioning the county allotment among the farms within the

accurate information possible on a the total acreage in cultivation and b the acreage of individual crops planted on each farm in the years 1941 1945 1946 and 1947 ii An eligible farm for war crop credit shall be a farm on which a the cotton acreage on the farm in 1945 1946 or 1947 was reduced below the cotton acreage planted on the farm in 1941 b the war crop acreage on the farm in 1945 1946 or 1947 was increased above the war crop acreage on the farm in 1941 and c the farm had a cotton acreage allotment in 1942 iii A farm shall be regarded as having planted cotton in addition to the actual acreage planted to cotton to the extent of the lesser of a the reduction in cotton acreage for each of the years 1945 1946 and 1947 below the acreage planted to cotton in 1941 or b the increase in war crops for each of the years 1945 1946 and 1947 above that planted to such war crops in 1941 However the county committee may be given the discretion to adjust such war crop credit when the

for cotton as of June 15 of the calendar year in which such crop is produced b The farm marketing excess of cotton shall be regarded as available for marketing and the amount of penalty shall be computed upon the normal production of the acreage on the farm planted to cotton in excess of the farm acreage allotment If a downward adjustment in the amount of the farm marketing excess is made pursuant to the proviso in section 1345 of this title the difference between the amount of the penalty computed upon the farm marketing excess before such adjustment and as computed upon the adjusted farm marketing excess shall be returned to or allowed the producer c The person liable for payment or collection of the penalty shall be liable also for interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date the penalty becomes due until the date of payment of such penalty d Until the penalty on the farm marketing excess is paid all cotton produced on the farm and marketed by the

which the national base acreage allotment is to be effective The national base acreage allotment for any crop of cotton shall be the number of acres which the Secretary determines on the basis of the expected national yield will produce an amount of cotton equal to the estimated domestic consumption of cotton standard bales of four hundred and eighty pounds net weight for the marketing year beginning in the year in which the crop is to be produced plus not to exceed 25 per centum thereof if the Secretary taking into consideration other actions he may take under the Agricultural Act of 1970 determines that such additional amount is necessary to provide for a production which will equal the national cotton production goal except that such national base acreage allotment shall be eleven million five hundred thousand acres for the 1971 crop and in the case of the 1972 through 1977 crops shall be in such amount as the Secretary determines necessary to maintain adequate supplies The national base acreage allotment for the 1974 through 1977 crops shall not be less than eleven million acres b Apportionment to States The national base acreage allotment for each crop of upland cotton shall be apportioned by the Secretary to the States on the basis of the acreage planted including acreage regarded as having been planted to upland cotton within the farm acreage allotment or the farm base acreage allotment whichever is in effect during the five calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the national cotton production goal is proclaimed with adjustments for abnormal weather conditions or other natural disaster during such period c Apportionment to counties The State base acreage allotment for each crop of upland cotton shall be apportioned to counties on the same basis as to years and conditions as is applicable to the State under subsection b Provided That the State committee may reserve not to exceed 2 per centum of its State acreage allotment which shall be used to make adjustments in county allotments for trends in acreage for counties adversely affected by abnormal conditions affecting plantings or for small or new farms or to correct inequities in farm allotments and to prevent hardships d Adjustment of apportionment bases for counties The Secretary shall adjust the apportionment base for each county as may be necessary because of transfers of allotments across county lines e Apportionment to farms 1 The county base acreage allotment for the 1971 crop shall be apportioned to old cotton farms in the county on the basis of the domestic acreage allotment established for the farm for the 1970 crop For the 1972 and each subsequent crop of upland cotton the county base acreage allotment shall be apportioned to old cotton farms in the county on the basis of the farm base acreage allotment established for such farm for the preceding year The county committee may reserve not in excess of 10 per centum of the county allotment which in addition to the acreage made available under the proviso in subsection c shall be used for A establishing allotments for farms on which cotton was not planted or regarded as planted during any of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the allotment is made on the basis of land labor and equipment available for the production of cotton crop rotation practices and the soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton and B making adjustments of the farm allotments established under this paragraph so as to establish allotments which are fair and reasonable in relation to the factors set forth in this paragraph and abnormal conditions of production on such farms or in making adjustments in farm allotments to correct inequities and to prevent hardships No part of such reserve shall be apportioned to a farm to reflect new cropland brought into production after November 30 1970 2 If for any crop the total acreage of cotton planted on a farm is less than the farm base acreage allotment the farm base acreage allotment used as a base for the succeeding crop shall be reduced by the percentage by which such planted acreage was less than such farm base acreage allotment but such reduction shall not exceed 20 per centum of the farm base acreage allotment for the preceding crop If not less than 90 per centum of the base acreage allotment for the farm is planted to cotton the farm shall be considered to have an acreage planted to cotton equal to 100 per centum of such allotment For purposes of this paragraph an acreage on the farm which the Secretary determines was not planted to cotton because of drought flood other natural disaster or a condition beyond the control of the producer shall be considered to be an acreage planted to cotton For the purpose of this paragraph the Secretary shall in the event producers of wheat or feed grains are permitted to do so permit producers of cotton to have acreage devoted to soybeans wheat feed grains guar castor beans triticale oats rye or such other crops as the Secretary may deem appropriate considered as devoted to the production of cotton to such extent and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines will not impair the effective operation of the cotton or soybean program 3 If no acreage is planted to cotton for any three consecutive crop years on any farm which had a farm base acreage allotment for such years such farm shall lose its base acreage allotment f Surrender of farm base acreage allotments Effective for the 1971 through 1977 crops any part of any farm base acreage allotment on which upland cotton will not be planted and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the farm base acreage allotment for such farm and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving farm base acreage allotments in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of past acreage of upland cotton land labor equipment available for the production of upland cotton crop rotation practices and soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of upland cotton If all of the acreage voluntarily surrendered is not needed in the county the county committee may surrender the excess acreage to the State committee to be used to make adjustments in farm base acreage allotments for other farms in the State adversely affected by abnormal conditions affecting plantings or to correct inequities or to prevent hardship Any farm base acreage allotment released under this provision shall be regarded for the purpose of establishing future farm base acreage allotments as

carryover inventory of sugar 3 Establishment of proportionate shares If the Secretary determines under paragraph 2 that the quantity of sugar produced from sugarcane produced by producers in the area covered by a State allotment for a crop year will be in excess of the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment for the crop year and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar the Secretary shall establish a proportionate share for each sugarcane producing farm that limits the acreage of sugarcane that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed during the crop year the allotment is in effect as provided in this subsection Each such proportionate share shall be subject to adjustment under paragraph 8 and section 1359cc g of this title 4 Method of determining For purposes of determining proportionate shares for any crop of sugarcane A The Secretary shall establish the State s per acre yield goal for a crop of sugarcane at a level not less than the average per acre yield in the State for the 2 highest years from among the 1999 2000 and 2001 crop years as determined by the Secretary that will ensure an adequate net return per pound to producers in the State taking into consideration any available production research data that the Secretary considers relevant B The Secretary shall adjust the per acre yield goal by the average recovery rate of sugar produced from sugarcane by processors in the State C The Secretary shall convert the State allotment for the crop year involved into a State acreage allotment for the crop by dividing the State allotment by the per acre yield goal for the State as established under subparagraph A and as further adjusted under subparagraph B D The Secretary shall establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by dividing the State acreage allotment as determined for the crop under subparagraph C by the sum of all adjusted acreage bases in the State as determined by the Secretary E The uniform reduction percentage for the crop as determined under subparagraph D shall be applied to the acreage base for each sugarcane producing farm in the State to determine the farm s proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be harvested for sugar or seed 5 Acreage base For purposes of this subsection the acreage base for each sugarcane producing farm shall be determined by the Secretary as follows A The acreage base for any farm shall be the number of acres that is equal to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on the farm in the 2 highest of the 1999 2000 and 2001 crop years B Acreage planted to sugarcane that producers on a farm were unable to harvest to sugarcane for sugar or seed because of drought flood other natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of the producers may be considered as harvested for the production of sugar or seed for purposes of this paragraph 6 Violation A In general Whenever proportionate shares are in effect in a State for a crop of sugarcane producers on a farm shall not knowingly harvest or allow to be harvested for sugar or seed an acreage of sugarcane in excess of the farm s proportionate share for the crop year or otherwise violate proportionate share regulations issued by the Secretary under section 1359hh a of this title B Determination of violation No

cause an immediate investigation to be made to determine whether the increase or termination is necessary to meet such emergency or increase in export demand If on the basis of such investigation the Secretary finds that such increase or termination is necessary he shall immediately proclaim such finding and if he finds an increase is necessary the amount of the increase found by him to be necessary and thereupon such quota or allotment shall be increased or shall terminate as the case may be c Increase of farm quota on increase of national quota In case any national marketing quota or

one of the great export crops of American agriculture and its production for domestic consumption and for export is necessary to the maintenance of a sound national economy and to the general welfare The movement of wheat from producer to consumer in the form of the commodity or any of the products thereof is preponderantly in interstate and foreign commerce Unreasonably low prices of wheat to producers impair their purchasing power for nonagriculture products and place them in a position of serious disparity with other industrial groups The conditions affecting the production of wheat are such that without Federal assistance producers cannot effectively prevent disastrously low prices for wheat It is necessary in order to assist wheat producers in obtaining fair prices to regulate the price of wheat used for domestic food and for exports in the manner provided in this part Feb 16 1938 ch 30 title III § 379a as added Pub L 87 – 703 title III § 324 2 Sept 27 1962 76 Stat 626

allocation for such year but not to exceed i the actual acreage of wheat planted on the farm for harvest in the calendar year in which the marketing year begins multiplied by the normal yield of wheat for the farm plus ii the amount of wheat stored under subsection b or to avoid or postpone a marketing quota penalty which is released from storage during the marketing year on account of underplanting or underproduction and if this limitation operates to reduce the amount of wheat marketing certificates which would otherwise be issued with respect to the farm such reduction shall be

marketing quota penalty is assessed for any commodity on such farm or in which the farm has not complied with the land use requirements of section 1339 of this title to the extent prescribed by the Secretary or in which except as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe the producer exceeds the farm acreage allotment on any other farm for any commodity in which he has an interest as a producer

producer with respect to any farm for any year in which a variety of wheat is planted on the farm which has been determined by the Secretary after consultation with State Agricultural Experiment Stations agronomists cereal chemists and other qualified technicians to have undesirable milling or baking qualities and has made public announcement thereof c Face value The Secretary shall determine and proclaim for each marketing year the face value per bushel of wheat marketing certificates The face value per bushel of domestic certificates shall be the amount by which the level of price support for wheat accompanied by domestic certificates exceeds the level of price support for wheat not accompanied by certificates noncertificate wheat d Statement or form of certificates and

prescribe e Failure of producer to comply with programs issuance of certificates In any case in which the failure of a producer to comply fully with the term and conditions of the programs formulated
