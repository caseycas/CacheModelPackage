2014 Committee Notes on Rules — 2014 This rule is derived from former Rule 8010 a and b and F R App P 28 Adopting much of the content of Rule 28 it provides greater detail than former Rule 8010 contained regarding appellate briefs Subdivision a prescribes the content and structure of the appellant s brief It largely follows former Rule 8010 a 1 but to ensure national uniformity it eliminates the provision authorizing a district court or BAP to alter these requirements Subdivision a 1 provides that when Rule 8012 requires an appellant to file a corporate disclosure statement it must be placed at the beginning of the appellant s brief Subdivision a 10 is new It implements the requirement under Rule 8015 a 7 C and b for the filing of a certificate of compliance with the limit on the number of words or lines allowed to be in a brief Subdivision b carries forward the provisions of former Rule 8010 a 2 Subdivision c is derived from F R App P 28 c It authorizes an appellant to file a reply brief which will generally complete the briefing process Subdivision d is similar to former Rule 8010 b but it is reworded to reflect the likelihood that briefs will generally be filed electronically rather than in paper form Subdivision e mirrors F R App P 28 i It authorizes multiple appellants or appellees to join in a single brief It also allows a party to incorporate by reference portions of another party s brief Subdivision f adopts the procedures of F R App P 28 j with respect to the filing of supplemental authorities with the district court or BAP after a brief has been filed or after oral argument Unlike the appellate rule it specifies a period of 7 days for filing a response to a submission of supplemental authorities The supplemental submission and response must comply with the signature requirements of Rule 8011 e Changes Made After Publication and Comment No changes were made after publication and comment Rule 8015 Form and Length of Briefs

rule is derived primarily from F R App P 32 Former Rule 8010 c prescribed page limits for principal briefs and reply briefs Those limits are now addressed by subdivision a 7 of this rule In addition the rule incorporates most of the detail of F R App P 32 regarding the appearance and format of briefs appendices and other documents along with new provisions that apply when those documents are filed electronically Subdivision a prescribes the form requirements for briefs that are filed in paper form It incorporates F R App P 32 a except it does not include color requirements for brief covers it requires the cover of a brief to include counsel s e mail address and cross references to the appropriate bankruptcy rules are substituted for references to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Subdivision a 7 decreases the length of briefs as measured by the number of pages that was permitted by former Rule 8010 c Page limits are reduced from 50 to 30 pages for a principal brief and from 25 to 15 for a reply brief in order to achieve consistency with F R App P 32 a 7 But as permitted by the appellate rule subdivision a 7 also permits the limits on the length of a brief to be measured by a word or line count as an alternative to a page limit Basing the calculation of brief length on either of the type volume methods specified in subdivision a 7 B will result in briefs that may exceed the designated page limits in a 7 A and that may be approximately as long as allowed by the prior page limits Subdivision b adapts for briefs that are electronically filed subdivision a s form requirements With the use of electronic filing the method of reproduction method of binding and use of paper become irrelevant But information required on the cover formatting requirements and limits on brief length remain the same Subdivisions c and d prescribe the form requirements for appendices Subdivision c applicable to paper appendices is derived from F R App P 32 b and subdivision d adapts those requirements for electronically filed appendices Subdivision e which is based on F R App P 32 c addresses the form required for documents — in paper form or electronically filed — that these rules do not otherwise cover Subdivision f like F R App P 32 e provides assurance to lawyers and parties that compliance with this rule s form requirements will allow a brief or other document to be accepted by any district court or BAP A court may however by local rule or under Rule 8028 by order in a particular case choose to accept briefs and documents that do not comply with all of this rule s requirements The decision whether to accept a brief that appears not to be in compliance with the rules must be made by the court Under Rule 8011 a 3 the clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local rule or practice Under Rule 8011 e the party filing the document or if represented its counsel must sign all briefs and other submissions If the document is filed electronically an electronic signature must be provided in accordance with Rule 8011 e Changes Made After Publication and Comment In subdivision f or order in a particular case was deleted as unnecessary The discussion in the Committee Note about brief lengths was revised and the discussion of subdivision f was expanded

Committee Notes on Rules — 2014 This rule is derived from F R App P 28 1 It governs the timing content length filing and service of briefs in bankruptcy appeals in which there is a cross appeal The former Part VIII rules did not separately address the topic of cross appeals Subdivision b prescribes which party is designated the appellant when there is a cross appeal Generally the first to file a notice of appeal will be the appellant Subdivision c specifies the briefs that the appellant and the appellee may file Because of the dual role of the parties to the appeal and cross appeal each party is permitted to file a principal brief and a response to the opposing party s brief as well as a reply brief For the appellee the principal brief in the cross appeal and the response in the appeal are combined into a single brief The appellant on the other hand initially files a principal brief in the appeal and later files a response to the appellee s principal brief in the cross appeal along with a reply brief in the appeal The final brief that may be filed is the appellee s reply brief in the cross appeal Subdivision d which prescribes page limits for briefs is adopted from F R App P 28 1 e It applies to briefs that are filed electronically as well as to those filed in paper form Like Rule 8015 a 7 it imposes limits measured by either the number of pages or the number of words or lines of text Subdivision e governs the time for filing briefs in cases in which there is a cross appeal It adapts the provisions of F R App P 28 1 f Changes Made After Publication and Comment Subdivision d 2 D was added and subdivision f was deleted In subdivision a the statement that Rule 8018 a does not apply was changed to refer to Rule 8018 a 1 – 3 In subdivision b Rule 8018 a 4 was added to the

argument which may be preceded by a summary and need not include a statement of the applicable standard of review and 6 a certificate of compliance if required by Rule 8015 a 7 C or 8015 b d Length Except by the district court s or BAP s permission an amicus brief must be no more than one half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party s principal brief If the court grants a party permission to file a longer brief that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief e Time for Filing An amicus curiae must file its brief accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant s principal brief is filed The district court or BAP may grant leave for later filing specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer f Reply Brief Except by the district court s or BAP s

BAP an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal — or the district court or BAP after notice may dismiss the appeal on its own motion An appellee who fails to file a brief will not be heard at oral argument unless the district court or BAP grants permission b Duty to Serve and File an Appendix to the Brief 1 Appellant Subject to subdivision e and Rule 8009 d the appellant must serve and file with its principal brief excerpts of the record as an appendix It must contain the following A the relevant entries in the bankruptcy docket B the complaint and answer or other equivalent filings C

procedure when there is no controlling law prior to revision of Part VIII Apr 25 2014 eff Dec 1 2014 Committee Notes on Rules — 2014 This rule is derived from former Rule 8009 and F R App P 30 and 31 Like former Rule 8009 it addresses the timing of serving and filing briefs and appendices as well as the content and format of appendices Rule 8011 governs the methods of filing and serving briefs and appendices The rule retains the bankruptcy practice of permitting the appellee to file its own appendix rather than requiring the appellant to include in its appendix matters designated by the appellee Rule 8016 governs the timing of serving and filing briefs when a cross appeal is taken This rule s provisions about appendices apply to all appeals including cross appeals Subdivision a retains former Rule 8009 s provision that allows the district court or BAP to dispense with briefing or to provide different time periods than this rule specifies It increases some of the time periods for filing briefs from the periods prescribed by the former rule while still retaining shorter time periods than some provided by F R App P 31 a The time for filing the appellant s brief is increased from 14 to 30 days after the docketing of the notice of the transmission of the record or notice of the availability of the record That triggering event is equivalent to docketing the appeal under former Rule 8007 Appellate Rule 31 a 1 by contrast provides the appellant 40 days after the record is filed to file its brief The shorter time period for bankruptcy appeals reflects the frequent need for greater expedition in the resolution of bankruptcy appeals while still providing the appellant more time to prepare its brief than the former rule provided Subdivision a 2 similarly expands the time period for filing the appellee s brief from 14 to 30 days after the service of the appellant s brief This period is the same as F R App P 31 a 1 provides Subdivision a 3 retains the 14 day time period for filing a reply brief that the former rule prescribed but it qualifies that period to ensure that the final brief is filed at least 7 days before oral argument If a district court or BAP has a mediation procedure for bankruptcy appeals that procedure could affect when briefs must be filed See Rule 8027 Subdivision a 4 is new Based on F R App P 31 c it provides for actions that may be taken — dismissal of the appeal or denial of participation in oral argument — if the appellant or appellee fails to file its brief Subdivisions b and c govern the content and format of the appendix to a brief Subdivision b is similar to former Rule 8009 b and subdivision c is derived from F R App P 30 d Subdivision d which addresses the inclusion of exhibits in the appendix is derived from F R App P 30 e Changes Made After Publication and Comment Subdivision a 4 was revised to provide more detail about the procedure for dismissing an appeal due to appellant s failure to timely file a brief Rule 8019 Oral Argument a Party s Statement Any party may file or a district court or BAP may require a statement explaining why oral argument should or need not be permitted b Presumption of Oral Argument and Exceptions Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless the district judge — or all the BAP judges assigned to hear the appeal — examine the briefs and record and determine that oral argument is unnecessary because 1 the appeal is frivolous 2 the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided or 3 the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument c Notice of Argument Postponement The district court or BAP must advise all parties of the date time and place for oral argument and the time allowed for each side A motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed reasonably in advance of the hearing date d Order and Contents of Argument The appellant opens and concludes the argument Counsel must not read at length from briefs the record or authorities e Cross Appeals and Separate Appeals If there is a cross appeal Rule 8016 b determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for the purposes of oral argument Unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise a cross appeal or separate appeal must be argued when the initial appeal is argued Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument f Nonappearance of a Party If the appellee fails to appear for argument the district court or BAP may hear the appellant s argument If the appellant fails to appear for argument the district court or BAP may hear the appellee s argument If neither party appears the case will be decided on the briefs unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise g Submission on Briefs The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs but the district court or BAP may direct that the case be argued h Use of Physical Exhibits at Argument Removal Counsel intending to use physical exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the day of the argument before the court convenes After the argument counsel must remove the exhibits from the courtroom unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise The clerk may destroy or dispose of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the clerk gives notice to remove them Added Apr 25 2014 eff Dec 1 2014 Prior Rule A prior Rule 8019 Apr 25 1983 eff Aug 1 1983 as amended

provisions of former Rule 8012 and adds much of the additional detail of F R App P 34 By incorporating the more detailed provisions of the appellate rule Rule 8019 promotes national uniformity regarding oral argument in bankruptcy appeals Subdivision a like F R App P 34 a 1 now allows a party to submit a statement explaining why oral argument is or is not needed It also authorizes a court to require this statement Former Rule 8012 only authorized statements explaining why oral argument should be allowed Subdivision b retains the reasons set forth in former Rule 8012 for the district court or BAP to conclude that oral argument is not needed The remainder of this rule adopts the provisions of F R App P 34 b – g with one exception Rather than requiring the district court or BAP to hear appellant s argument if the appellee does not appear subdivision f authorizes the district court or BAP to go forward with the argument in the appellee s absence Should the court decide however to postpone the oral argument in that situation it would be authorized to do so Changes Made After Publication and Comment No changes were made after publication and comment Rule 8020 Frivolous Appeal and Other Misconduct a Frivolous Appeal — Damages and Costs If the district court or BAP determines that an appeal is frivolous it may after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee b Other Misconduct The district court or BAP may discipline or sanction an attorney or party appearing before it for other misconduct including failure to comply with any court order First however the court must afford the attorney or party reasonable notice an opportunity to show cause to the contrary

to be done and proceedings to be had in cases under the Code and any litigation arising therein Subdivision b is patterned after Rule 6 b F R Civ P and Rule 26 b F R App P Paragraph 1 of this subdivision confers on the court discretion generally to authorize extensions of time for doing acts required or allowed by these rules or orders of court The exceptions to this general authority to extend the time are contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 In the interest of prompt administration of bankruptcy cases certain time periods may not be extended Paragraph 2 lists the rules which establish

of fact Rule 9015 f 20 day period to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict Rule 9023 10 day period to move for a new trial and Rule 9024 time to move for relief from judgment Many rules which establish a time for doing an act also contain a specific authorization and standard for granting an extension of time and in some cases limit the length of an extension In some instances it would be inconsistent with the objective of the rule and sound administration of the case to permit extension under Rule 9006 b 1 but with respect to the other rules it is appropriate that the power to extend time be supplemented by Rule 9006 b 1 Unless a rule which contains a specific authorization to extend time is listed in paragraph 3 of this subdivision an extension of the time may be granted under paragraph 1 of this subdivision If a rule is included in paragraph 3 an extension may not be granted under paragraph 1 The following rules are listed in paragraph 3 Rule 1006 b 2 time for paying the

periods fixed in the rules referred to in this subdivision would be inconsistent with the purposes of those rules and would cause harmful uncertainty Subdivision d is derived from Rule 6 d F R Civ P The reference is to Rule 9023 instead of to Rule 59 c F R Civ P because Rule 9023 incorporates Rule 59 F R Civ P but excepts therefrom motions to reconsider orders allowing and disallowing claims Subdivision f is new and is the same as Rule 6 e F R Civ P Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment Subdivision a is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to Rule 6 F R Civ P Subdivision b The reference to Rule 4001 b in paragraph 3 is deleted because of the amendments made to Rule 4001 Rule 9033 which is new contains specific provisions governing the extension of time to

motion to use cash collateral or a motion for authority to obtain credit may be held no earlier than 15 days after the filing of the motion These two rules are added to paragraph 2 to make it clear that the 15 day period may not be reduced Rule 9033 is also added to paragraph 2 Subdivision g is new Under § 557 of the Code as enacted by the 1984 amendments the court is directed to expedite grain storage facility cases This subdivision makes it clear this rule does not limit the court s authority under § 557 The original Advisory Committee Note to this rule included the 25 day notice period of Rule 2002 b as a time period which may not be reduced under Rule 9006 c 2 This was an error Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1989 Amendment Prior to 1987 subdivision a provided that intermediate weekends and legal holidays would not be counted in the computation of a time period if the prescribed or allowed time was less than 7 days This rule was amended in 1987 to conform to Fed R Civ P 6 a which provides for the exclusion of intermediate weekends and legal holidays if the time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days An undesirable result of the 1987 amendment was that 10 day time periods prescribed in the interest of prompt administration of bankruptcy cases were extended to at least 14 calendar days As a result of the present amendment 10 day time periods prescribed or allowed will no longer be extended to at least 14 calendar days because of intermediate weekends and legal holidays Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment As a result of the 1989 amendment to this rule the method of computing time under subdivision a is not the same as the method of computing time under Rule 6 a F R Civ P Subdivision a is amended to provide that it governs the computation of time periods prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when the Bankruptcy Rules make a civil rule applicable to a bankruptcy case or proceeding Subdivision b 2 is amended because of the deletion of Rule 1019 2 Reference to Rule 9015 f is deleted because of the abrogation of Rule 9015 in 1987 Subdivision b 3 is amended to limit the enlargement of time regarding dismissal of a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse in accordance with Rule 1017 e Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1996 Amendment Subdivision c 2 is amended to conform to the abrogation of Rule 2002 a 4 and the renumbering of Rule 2002 a 8 to Rule 2002 a 7 GAP Report on Rule 9006 No changes since publication except for a stylistic change Committee Notes on Rules — 1999 Amendment Rule 9006 b 2 is amended to conform to the abrogation of Rule 1017 b 3 GAP Report on Rule 9006 The proposed amendment to Rule 9006 b 2 has been added as a technical change to conform to the abrogation of Rule 1017 b 3 The proposed amendment to Rule 9006 c 2 providing that the time under Rule 1019 6 to file a request for payment of an administrative expense after a case is converted to chapter 7 could not be reduced by the court was deleted The proposed amendments to Rule 1019 6 have been changed so that the court will fix the time for filing the request for payment Since the court will fix the time limit the court should have the power to reduce it See GAP Report to Rule 1019 6 Committee Notes on Rules — 2001 Amendment Rule 5 b F R Civ P which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7005 is being restyled and amended to authorize service by electronic means — or any other means not otherwise authorized under Rule 5 b — if consent is obtained from the person served The amendment to Rule 9006 f is intended to extend the three day mail rule to service under Rule 5 b 2 D including service by electronic means The three day rule also will apply to service under Rule 5 b 2 C F R Civ P when the person served has no known address and the paper is served by leaving a copy with the clerk of the court Changes Made After Publication and Comments No changes were made Committee Notes on Rules — 2005 Amendment Rule 9006 f is amended consistent with a corresponding amendment to Rule 6 e of the F R Civ P to clarify the method of counting the number of days to respond after service either by mail or under Civil Rule 5 b 2 C or D Three days are added after the prescribed period expires If before the application of Rule 9006 f the prescribed period is less than 8 days intervening Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays are excluded from the calculation under Rule 9006 a Some illustrations may be helpful Under existing Rule 9006 a assuming that there are no legal holidays and that a response is due in seven days if a paper is filed on a Monday the seven day response period commences on Tuesday and concludes on Wednesday of the next week Adding three days to the end of the period would extend it to Saturday but because the response period ends on a weekend the response day would be the following Monday two weeks after the filing of the initial paper If the paper is filed on a Tuesday the seven day response period would end on the following Thursday and the response time would also be the following Monday If the paper is mailed on a Wednesday the initial seven day period would expire nine days later on a Friday but the response would again be due on the following Monday because of Rule 9006 f If the paper is mailed on a Thursday however the seven day period ends on Monday eleven days after the mailing of the service because of the exclusion of the two intervening Saturdays and Sundays The response is due three days later on the following Thursday If the paper is mailed on a Friday the seven day period would conclude on a Tuesday and the response is due three days later on a Friday No other change in the system of counting time is intended Other changes are stylistic Changes Made After Publication and Comment The phrase would otherwise expire under Rule 9006 a was added to the end of the rule to clarify further that the three day extension is to be added to the end of the period that is established under the counting provisions of Rule 9006 a This also maintains a parallel construction with Civil Rule 6 e in which the same addition to the rule was made after the public comment period Committee Notes on Rules — 2008 Amendment Subdivision b 3 is amended to implement § 1116 3 of the Code as amended by the 2005 amendments which places specific limits on the extension of time for filing schedules and statements of financial affairs in a small business case Subdivisions b 3 and c 2 are amended to provide that enlargement or reduction of the time to file the statement of completion of a personal financial management course required by Rule 1007 b 7 are governed by Rule 1007 c Likewise the amendments to subdivisions b 3 and c 2 recognize that the enlargement of time to file a reaffirmation agreement is governed by Rule 4008 a and that reduction of the time provided under that rule is not permitted Other amendments are stylistic Changes Made After Publication Subdivision b 3 was amended to provide that Rule 9006 does not govern the enlargement of time to file a reaffirmation agreement the statement required under Rule 1007 b 7 or the time to file schedules and statements of financial affairs in small business cases The title of subdivision b 3 was also amended to more accurately describe the operation of the provision Subdivision c 2 was amended to recognize that the court may not reduce the time under Rule 1007 c to file the statement required by Rule 1007 b 7 Committee Notes on Rules — 2009 Amendment Subdivision a Subdivision a has been amended to simplify and clarify the provisions that describe how deadlines are computed Subdivision a governs the computation of any time period found in a Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure a statute a local rule or a court order In accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9029 a a local rule may not direct that a deadline be computed in a manner inconsistent with subdivision a The time computation provisions of subdivision a apply only when a time period must be computed They do not apply when a fixed time to act is set The amendments thus carry forward the approach taken in Violette v P A Days Inc 427 F 3d 1015 1016 6th Cir 2005 holding that Civil Rule 6 a does not apply to situations where the court has established a specific calendar day as a deadline and reject the contrary holding of In re American Healthcare Management Inc 900 F 2d 827 832 5th Cir 1990 holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006 a governs treatment of date certain deadline set by court order If for example the date for filing is no later than November 1 2007 subdivision a does not govern But if a filing is required to be made within 10 days or within 72 hours subdivision a describes how that deadline is computed Subdivision a does not apply when computing a time period set by a statute if the statute specifies a method of computing time See e g 11 U S C § 527 a 2 debt relief agencies must provide a written notice to an assisted person not later than 3 business days after providing bankruptcy assistance services Subdivision a 1 New subdivision a 1 addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in days It also applies to time periods that are stated in weeks months or years See e g Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 c 1 made applicable to bankruptcy cases under Rule 9024 Subdivision a 1 B s directive to count every day is relevant only if the period is stated in days not weeks months or years Under former Rule 9006 a a period of eight days or more was computed differently than a period of less than eight days Intermediate Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays were included in computing the longer periods but excluded in computing the shorter periods Former Rule 9006 a thus made computing deadlines unnecessarily complicated and led to counterintuitive results Under new subdivision a 1 all deadlines stated in days no matter the length are computed in the same way The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted All other days — including intermediate Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays — are counted with only one exception If the period ends on a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday then the deadline falls on the next day that is not a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday An illustration is provided below in the discussion of subdivision a 5 Subdivision a 3 addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day when the clerk s office is inaccessible Where subdivision a formerly referred to the act event or default that triggers the deadline new subdivision a refers simply to the event that triggers the deadline this change in terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity and is not intended to change meaning Periods previously expressed as less than eight days will be shortened as a practical matter by the decision to count intermediate Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays in computing all periods Many of those periods have been lengthened to compensate for the change See e g Rules 2008 trustee s duty to notify court of acceptance of the appointment within five days is extended to seven days 6004 b time for filing and service of objection to proposed use sale or lease of property extended from five days prior to the hearing to seven days prior to the hearing and 9006 d time for giving notice of a hearing extended from five days prior to the hearing to seven days Most of the 10 day periods were adjusted to meet the change in computation method by setting 14 days as the new period See e g Rules 1007 h 10 day period to file supplemental schedule for property debtor becomes entitled to acquire after the commencement of the case is extended to 14 days 3020 e 10 day stay of order confirming a chapter 11 plan extended to 14 days 8002 a 10 day period in which to file notice of appeal extended to 14 days A 14 day period also has the advantage that the final day falls on the same day of the week as the event that triggered the period — the14th day after a Monday for example is a Monday This advantage of using week long periods led to adopting seven day periods to replace some of the periods set at less than 10 days 21 day periods to replace 20 day periods and 28 day periods to replace 25 day periods Thirty day and longer periods however were generally retained without change Subdivision a 2 New subdivision a 2 addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in hours No such deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours as do some court orders issued in expedited proceedings Under subdivision a 2 a deadline stated in hours starts to run immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the deadline The deadline generally ends when the time expires If however the time period expires at a specific time say 2 17 p m on a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday then the deadline is extended to the same time 2 17 p m on the next day that is not a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday Periods stated in hours are not to be rounded up to the next whole hour Subdivision a 3 addresses situations when the clerk s office is inaccessible during the last hour before a filing deadline expires Subdivision a 2 B directs that every hour be counted Thus for example a 72 hour period that commences at 10 23 a m on Friday November 2 2007 will run until 9 23 a m on Monday November 5 the discrepancy in start and end times in this example results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time to standard time Subdivision a 3 When determining the last day of a filing period stated in days or a longer unit of time a day on which the clerk s office is not accessible because of the weather or another reason is treated like a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday When determining the end of a filing period stated in hours if the clerk s office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing period computed under subdivision a 2 then the period is extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend holiday or day when the clerk s office is inaccessible Subdivision a 3 s extensions apply [ u ] nless the court orders otherwise In some circumstances the court might not wish a period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24 hour extension in those instances the court can specify a briefer extension The text of the rule no longer refers to weather or other conditions as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk s office The reference to weather was deleted from the text to underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to weather such as an outage of the electronic filing system Weather can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk s office The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility Rather the concept will continue to develop through caselaw See e g William G Phelps When Is Office of Clerk of Court Inaccessible Due to Weather or Other Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6 a of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 135 A L R Fed 259 1996 collecting cases In addition many local provisions address inaccessibility for purposes of electronic filing See e g D Kan Rule 5 4 11 A Filing User whose filing is made untimely as the result of a technical failure may seek appropriate relief from the court Subdivision a 4 New subdivision a 4 defines the end of the last day of a period for purposes of subdivision a 1 Subdivision a 4 does not apply in computing periods stated in hours under subdivision a 2 and does not apply if a different time is set by a statute local rule or order in the case A local rule may provide for example that papers filed in a drop box after the normal hours of the clerk s office are filed as of the day that is date stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box 28 U S C § 452 provides that [ a ] ll courts of the United States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper papers issuing and returning process and making motions and orders A corresponding provision exists in Rule 5001 a Some courts have held that these provisions permit an after hours filing by handing the papers to an appropriate official See e g Casalduc v Diaz 117 F 2d 915 917 1st Cir 1941 Subdivision a 4 does not address the effect of the statute on the question of after hours filing instead the rule is designed to deal with filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452 Subdivision a 5 New subdivision a 5 defines the next day for purposes of subdivisions a 1 C and a 2 C The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure contain both forward looking time periods and backward looking time periods A forward looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time after an event See e g Rules 1007 c [] the schedules statements and other documents shall be filed by the debtor within 14 days of the entry of the order for relief 1019 5 B ii the trustee not later than 30 days after conversion of the case shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report and account and 7012 a If a complaint is duly served the defendant shall serve an answer within 30 days after the issuance of the summons except when a different time is prescribed by the court A backward looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time before an event See e g Rules 6004 b an objection to a proposed use sale or lease of property shall be filed and served not less than seven days before the date set for the proposed action 9006 d A written motion other than one which may be heard ex parte and notice of any hearing shall be served not later than seven days before the time specified for such hearing In determining what is the next day for purposes of subdivisions a 1 C and a 2 C one should continue counting in the same direction — that is forward when computing a forward looking period and backward when computing a backward looking period If for example a filing is due within 10 days after an event and the tenth day falls on Saturday September 1 2007 then the filing is due on Tuesday September 4 2007 Monday September 3 is Labor Day But if a filing is due 10 days before an event and the tenth day falls on Saturday September 1 then the filing is due on Friday August 31 Subdivision a 6 New subdivision a 6 defines legal holiday for purposes of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure including the time computation provisions of subdivision a Subdivision a 6 continues to include within the definition of legal holiday days that are declared a holiday by the President or Congress For forward counted periods — i e periods that are measured after an event — subdivision a 6 C includes certain state holidays within the definition of legal holidays and defines the term state — for purposes of subdivision a 6 — to include the District of Columbia and any commonwealth or territory of the United States Thus for purposes of subdivision a 6 s definition of legal holiday state includes the District of Columbia Guam American Samoa the U S Virgin Islands the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands However state legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward counted periods For both forward and backward counted periods the rule thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state holidays For forward counted deadlines treating state holidays the same as federal holidays extends the deadline Thus someone who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing In contrast for backward counted deadlines not giving state holidays the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state holiday itself rather than the day before Take for example Monday April 21 2008 Patriot s Day a legal holiday in the relevant state If a filing is due 14 days after an event and the fourteenth day is April 21 then the filing is due on Tuesday April 22 because Monday April 21 counts as a legal holiday But if a filing is due 14 days before an event and the fourteenth day is April 21 the filing is due on Monday April 21 the fact that April 21 is a state holiday does not make April 21 a legal holiday for purposes of computing this backward counted deadline But note that if the clerk s office is inaccessible on Monday April 21 then subdivision a 3 extends the April 21 filing deadline forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday — no earlier than Tuesday April 22 Changes Made After Publication The reference to Rule 6 a 1 in subdivision a 3 A at line 50 of the rule as it was published was corrected by referring instead to Rule 9006 a 1 The Standing Committee changed Rule 9006 a 6 to exclude state holidays from the definition of legal holiday for purposes of computing backward counted periods conforming changes were made to the Committee Note to subdivision a 6 In addition the term possession was deleted from the definition of state in subdivision a 6 and a conforming change was made to the Committee Note [ Subdivision d ] The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006 a and the manner by which time is computed under the rules The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days Throughout the rules deadlines are amended in the following manner • 5 day periods become 7 day periods • 10 day periods become 14 day periods • 15 day periods become 14 day periods • 20 day periods become 21 day periods • 25 day periods become 28 day periods Subdivision f is amended to conform to the changes made to Rule 5 b 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a part of the Civil Rules Restyling Project As a part of that project subparagraphs b 2 C and D of that rule were rewritten as subparagraphs b 2 D E and F The cross reference to those rules contained in subdivision f of this rule is corrected by this amendment Committee Notes on Rules — 2013 Amendment The title of this rule is amended to draw attention to the fact that it prescribes time limits for the service of motion papers These time periods apply unless another Bankruptcy Rule or a court order including a local rule prescribes different time periods Rules 9013 and 9014 should also be consulted regarding motion practice Rule 9013 governs the form of motions and the parties who must be served Rule 9014 prescribes the procedures applicable to contested matters including the method of serving motions commencing contested matters and subsequent papers Subdivision d is amended to apply to any written response to a motion rather than just to opposing affidavits The caption of the subdivision is amended to reflect this change Other changes are stylistic Changes Made

Forms prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States shall be observed and used with alterations as may be appropriate Forms may be combined and their contents rearranged to permit economies in their use The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may issue additional forms for use under the Code The forms shall be construed to be consistent with these rules and the Code As amended Apr 30 1991 eff Aug 1 1991 Apr 23 2008 eff Dec 1 2008 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 The rule continues the obligatory character of the Official Forms in the interest of facilitating the processing of the paperwork of bankruptcy administration but provides that Official Forms will be prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States The Supreme Court and the Congress will thus be relieved of the burden of considering the large number of complex forms used in bankruptcy practice The use of the Official Forms has generally been held subject to a rule of substantial compliance and some of these rules for example Rule 1002 specifically state that the filed document need only conform substantially to the Official Form See also Rule 9005 The second sentence recognizes the propriety of combining and rearranging Official Forms to take advantage of technological developments and resulting economies The Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to issue additional forms for the guidance of the bar Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment Rule 9029 [ 9009 ] is amended to clarify that local court rules may not prohibit or limit the use of the Official Forms Committee Notes on Rules — 2008 Amendment The rule is amended to provide that a plan proponent in a small business chapter 11 case need not use an Official Form of a plan of reorganization and disclosure statement The use of those forms is optional and under Rule 3016 d the proponent may submit a plan and disclosure statement in those cases that

allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or if specifically so identified are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery and 4 the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or if specifically so identified are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief c Sanctions If after notice

made by or against the party which is or whose attorneys are to be sanctioned 3 Order When imposing sanctions the court shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed d Inapplicability To Discovery Subdivisions a through c of this rule do not apply to disclosures and discovery requests responses objections and motions that

harbor provision contained in subdivision c 1 A which prohibits the filing of a motion for sanctions unless the challenged paper is not withdrawn or corrected within a prescribed time after service of the motion does not apply if the challenged paper is a petition The filing of a petition has immediate serious consequences including the imposition of the automatic stay under § 362 of the Code which may not be avoided by the subsequent withdrawal of the petition In addition a petition for relief under chapter 7 or chapter 11 may not be withdrawn unless the court orders dismissal of the case for

directs otherwise 26 a 1 mandatory disclosure 26 a 2 disclosures regarding expert testimony and 26 a 3 additional pre trial disclosure and 26 f mandatory meeting before scheduling conference discovery plan An entity that desires to perpetuate testimony may proceed in the same manner as provided in Rule 7027 for the taking of a deposition before an adversary proceeding The court may at any stage in a particular matter direct that one or more of the other rules in Part VII shall apply The court shall give the parties notice of any order issued under this paragraph to afford them a reasonable opportunity to comply with the procedures prescribed by the order d Testimony of Witnesses Testimony of witnesses with respect to disputed material factual issues shall be taken in the same manner as testimony in an adversary proceeding e Attendance of Witnesses The court shall provide procedures that enable parties to ascertain at a reasonable time before any scheduled hearing whether the hearing

1 2013 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Rules 1017 d 3020 b 1 4001 a 4003 d and 6006 a which govern respectively dismissal or conversion of a case objections to confirmation of a plan relief from the automatic stay and the use of cash collateral avoidance of a lien under § 552 f of the Code and the assumption or rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases specifically provide that litigation under those rules shall be as provided in Rule 9014 This rule also governs litigation in other contested matters Whenever there is an actual dispute other than an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court the litigation to resolve that dispute is a contested matter For example the filing of an objection to a proof of claim to a claim of exemption or to a disclosure statement creates a dispute which is a contested matter Even when an objection is not formally required there may be a dispute If a party in interest opposes the amount of compensation sought by a professional there is a dispute which is a contested matter When the rules of Part VII are applicable to a contested matter reference in the Part VII rules to adversary proceedings is to be read as a reference to a contested matter See Rule 9002 1 Committee Notes on Rules — 1999 Amendment This rule is amended to delete Rule 7062 from the list of Part VII rules that automatically apply in a contested matter Rule 7062 provides that Rule 62 F R Civ P which governs stays of proceedings to enforce a judgment is applicable in adversary proceedings The provisions of Rule 62 including the ten day automatic stay of the enforcement of a judgment provided by Rule 62 a and the stay as a matter of right by posting a supersedeas bond provided in Rule 62 d are not appropriate for most orders granting or denying motions governed by Rule 9014 Although Rule 7062 will not apply automatically in contested matters the amended rule permits the court in its discretion to order that Rule 7062 apply in a particular matter and Rule 8005 gives the court discretion to issue a stay or any other appropriate order during the pendency of an appeal on such terms as will protect the rights of all parties in interest In addition amendments to Rules 3020 4001 6004 and 6006 automatically stay certain types of orders for a period of ten days unless the court orders otherwise GAP Report on Rule 9014 No changes since publication Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment The list of Part VII rules that are applicable in a contested matter is extended to include Rule 7009 on pleading special matters and Rule 7017 on real parties in interest infants and incompetent persons and capacity The discovery rules made applicable in adversary proceedings apply in contested matters unless the court directs otherwise Subdivision b is amended to permit parties to serve papers other than the original motion in the manner provided in Rule 5 b F R Civ P When the court requires a response to the motion this amendment will permit service of the response in the same manner as an answer is served in an adversary proceeding Subdivision d is added to clarify that if the motion cannot be decided without resolving a disputed material issue of fact an evidentiary hearing must be held at which testimony of witnesses is taken in the same manner as testimony is taken in an adversary proceeding or at a trial in a district court civil case Rule 43 a rather than Rule 43 e F R Civ P would govern the evidentiary hearing on the factual dispute Under Rule 9017 the Federal Rules of Evidence also apply in a contested matter Nothing in the rule prohibits a court from resolving any matter that is submitted on affidavits by agreement of the parties Subdivision e Local procedures for hearings and other court appearances in a contested matter vary from district to district In some bankruptcy courts an evidentiary hearing at which witnesses may testify usually is held at the first court appearance in the contested matter In other courts it is customary for the court to delay the evidentiary hearing on disputed factual issues until some time after the initial hearing date In order to avoid unnecessary expense and inconvenience it is important for attorneys to know whether they should bring witnesses to a court appearance The purpose of the final sentence of this rule is to require that the court provide a mechanism that will enable attorneys to know at a reasonable time before a scheduled hearing whether it will be necessary for witnesses to appear in court on that particular date Other amendments to this rule are stylistic Changes Made After Publication and Comments The Advisory Committee made two changes to subdivision d after considering the comments received addressing the proposed rule First the word material is inserted to make explicit that which was implied in the published version of the proposed rule Second the reference to F R Civ P 43 a was removed The purpose of proposed subdivision d was to recognize that testimony should be taken in the same manner in both contested matters and adversary proceedings The revision to the published rule states this more directly The Committee Note was amended to reflect the changes made in the text of the rule Committee Notes on Rules — 2004 Amendment The rule is amended to provide that the mandatory disclosure requirements of Fed R Civ P 26 as incorporated by Rule 7026 do not apply in contested matters The typically short time between the commencement and resolution of most contested matters makes the mandatory disclosure provisions of Rule 26 ineffective Nevertheless the court may by local rule or by order in a particular case provide that these provisions of the rule apply in a contested matter Changes Made After Publication No changes since publication Committee Notes on Rules — 2013 Amendment A cross reference to Rule 9006 d is added to subdivision b to call attention to the time limits

intended to expand or create any right to trial by jury where such right does not otherwise exist GAP Report on Rule 9015 No changes to the published draft Committee Notes on Rules — 2009 Amendment The rule is amended by deleting Rule 50 F R Civ P from the list in subdivision a of rules made applicable in cases and proceedings However subdivision c is added to make Rule 50 applicable in cases and proceedings but it limits the time for filing certain post judgment motions to 14 days after the entry of judgment The amendment is necessary because Rule 50 F R Civ P was amended in 2009 to extend the deadline for the filing of these post judgment motions to 28 days That deadline corresponds to the 30 day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4 a 1 A F R App P In a bankruptcy case the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days Therefore the 28 day deadline for filing these post judgment motions would effectively override the notice of appeal deadline

entity in respect of a trade secret or other confidential research development or commercial information 2 to protect any entity against scandalous or defamatory matter contained in any paper filed in a case under the Code or 3 to protect governmental matters that are made confidential by statute or regulation If an order is entered under this rule without notice any entity affected thereby may move to vacate or modify the order and after a hearing on notice the court shall determine the motion As amended Mar 30 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 This rule

to railroad reorganizations Subdivision b permits the court to deal efficiently with a case in which there may be a large number of settlements Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to object or otherwise be heard in connection with a proposed compromise or settlement and otherwise to monitor the progress of the case Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 Amendment Subdivision a is amended to conform to the language of § 102 1 of the Code Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change Rule 9020 Contempt Proceedings Rule 9014 governs a motion for an order of contempt made by the United States trustee or a party in interest As amended Mar 30 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 30 1991 eff Aug 1 1991 Apr 23 2001 eff Dec 1 2001 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Section 1481 of Title 28 provides that a bankruptcy court may not punish a criminal contempt not committed in the presence of the judge of the court or warranting a punishment of imprisonment Rule 9020 does not enlarge the power of bankruptcy courts Subdivision a is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 920 and Rule 42 F R Crim P Paragraph 1 of the subdivision permits summary imposition of punishment for contempt if the conduct is in the presence of the court and is of such nature that the conduct obstruct [ s ] the administration of justice See 18 U S C § 401 a Cases interpreting Rule 42 a F R Crim P have held that when criminal contempt is in question summary disposition should be the exception summary disposition should be reserved for situations where it is necessary to protect the judicial institution 3 Wright Federal Practice & Procedure — Criminal § 707 1969 Those cases are equally pertinent to the application of this rule and therefore contemptuous conduct in the presence of the judge may often be punished only after the notice and hearing requirements of subdivision b are satisfied If the bankruptcy court concludes it is without power to punish or to impose the proper punishment for conduct which constitutes contempt subdivision a 3 authorizes the bankruptcy court to certify the matter to the district court Subdivision b makes clear that when a person has a constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial in a criminal contempt matter this rule in no way affects that right See Frank v United States 395 U S 147 1969 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specifically provide the procedure for the imposition of civil contempt sanctions The decisional law governing the procedure for imposition of civil sanctions by the district courts will be equally applicable to the bankruptcy courts Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment The United States Bankruptcy Courts as constituted under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 were courts of law equity and admiralty with an inherent contempt power but former 28 U S C § 1481 restricted the criminal contempt power of bankruptcy judges Under the 1984 amendments bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court 28 U S C §§ 151 152 a 1 There are no decisions by the courts of appeals concerning the authority of bankruptcy judges to punish for either civil or criminal contempt under the 1984 amendments This rule as amended recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to punish for contempt Sound judicial administration requires that the initial determination of whether contempt has been committed should be made by the bankruptcy judge If timely objections are not filed to the bankruptcy judge s order the order has the same force and effect as an order of the district court If objections are filed within 10 days of service of the order the district court conducts a de novo review pursuant to Rule 9033 and any order of contempt is entered by the district court on completion of the court s review of the bankruptcy judge s order Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment The words with the clerk in subdivision c are deleted as unnecessary See Rules 5005 a and 9001 3 Committee Notes on Rules — 2001 Amendment The amendments to this rule cover a motion for an order of contempt filed by the United States trustee or a party in interest This rule as amended does not address a contempt proceeding initiated by the court sua sponte Whether the court is acting on motion under this rule or is acting sua sponte these amendments are not intended to extend limit or otherwise affect either the contempt power of a bankruptcy judge or the role of the district judge regarding contempt orders Issues relating to the contempt power of bankruptcy judges are substantive and are left to statutory and judicial development rather than procedural rules This rule as amended in 1987 delayed for ten days from service the effectiveness of a bankruptcy judge s order of contempt and rendered the order subject to de novo review by the district court These limitations on contempt orders were added to the rule in response to the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 Pub L No 98 – 353 98 Stat 333 which provides that bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court but does not specifically mention contempt power See 28 U S C § 151 As explained in the committee note to the 1987 amendments to this rule no decisions of the courts of appeals existed concerning the authority of a bankruptcy judge to punish for either civil or criminal contempt under the 1984 Act and therefore the rule as amended in 1987 recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to punish for contempt Committee Note to 1987 Amendments to Rule 9020 Since 1987 several courts of appeals have held that bankruptcy judges have the power to issue civil contempt orders See e g Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube Inc 108 F 3d 609 5th Cir 1997 In re Rainbow Magazine Inc 77 F 3d 278 9th Cir 1996 Several courts have distinguished between a bankruptcy judge s civil contempt power and criminal contempt power See e g Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube Inc 108 F 3d at 613 n 3 [ a ] lthough we find that bankruptcy judge s [ sic ] can find a party in civil contempt we must point out that bankruptcy courts lack the power to hold persons in criminal contempt For other decisions regarding criminal contempt power see e g In re Ragar 3 F 3d 1174 8th Cir 1993 Matter of Hipp Inc 895 F 2d 1503 5th Cir 1990 To the extent that Rule 9020 as amended in 1987 delayed the effectiveness of civil contempt orders and required de novo review by the district court the rule may have been unnecessarily restrictive in view of judicial decisions recognizing that bankruptcy judges have the power to hold parties in civil contempt Subdivision d which provides that the rule shall not be construed to impair the right to trial by jury is deleted as unnecessary and is not intended to deprive any party of the right to a jury trial when it otherwise exists Changes Made After Publication and Comments No changes were made in the text of the proposed amendments Stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note Rule 9021 Entry of Judgment A judgment or order is effective when entered under Rule 5003 As amended Mar 30 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Mar 26 2009 eff Dec 1 2009 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Subdivision a This rule is derived from Rule 58 F R Civ P The requirement that a judgment entered in an adversary proceeding or contested matter be set forth on a separate document is to eliminate uncertainty as to whether an opinion or memorandum of the court is a judgment There is no sound reason to require that every order in a case under the Code be evidenced by a separate document Subdivision b establishes a procedure for entering a judgment of a bankruptcy court for the recovery of money or property in an index of judgments kept by the clerk of the district court It clarifies the availability of the same remedies for the enforcement of a bankruptcy court judgment as those provided for the enforcement of a district court judgment See 28 U S C §§ 1961 – 63 When indexed in accordance with subdivision b of this rule a judgment of the bankruptcy court may be found by anyone searching for liens of record in the judgment records of the district court Certification of a copy of the judgment to the clerk of the district court provides a basis for registration of the judgment pursuant to 28 U S C § 1963 in any other district When so registered the judgment may be enforced by issuance of execution and orders for supplementary proceedings that may be served anywhere within the state where the registering court sits See 7 Moore Federal Practice 2409 – 11 2d ed 1971 The procedures available in the district court are not exclusive however and the holder of a judgment entered by the bankruptcy court may use the remedies under Rules 7069 and 7070 even if the judgment is indexed by the clerk of the district court Subdivision c makes it clear that when a district court hears a matter reserved to it by 28 U S C §§ 1471 1481 its judgments are entered in the district court s civil docket and in the docket of the bankruptcy court When the district court acts as an appellate court Rule 8016 a governs the entry of judgments on appeal Notes of Advisory Committee on

if the claim or cause of action in a civil action has been stayed under § 362 of the Code or C 30 days after a trustee qualifies in a chapter 11 reorganization case but not later than 180 days after the order for relief 3 Time for filing civil action initiated after commencement of the case under the Code If a claim or cause of action is asserted in another court after the commencement of a case under the Code a notice of removal may be filed with the clerk only within the shorter of A 30 days after receipt through service or otherwise of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim or cause of action sought to be removed or B 30 days after receipt of the summons if the initial pleading has been filed with the court but not served with the summons b Notice Promptly after filing the notice of removal the party filing the notice shall serve a copy of it on all parties to the removed claim or cause of action c Filing in Non Bankruptcy Court Promptly after filing the notice of removal the party filing the notice shall file a copy of it with the clerk of the court from which the claim or cause of action is removed Removal of the claim or cause of action is effected on such

or cause of action shall be governed by Rule 9014 and served on the parties to the removed claim or cause of action e Procedure After Removal 1 After removal of a claim or cause of action to a district court the district court or if the case under the Code has been referred to a bankruptcy judge of the district the bankruptcy judge may issue all necessary orders and process to bring before it all proper parties whether served by process issued by the court from which the claim or cause of action was removed or otherwise 2 The district court or if the case under the Code has been referred to a bankruptcy judge of the district the bankruptcy judge may require the party filing the notice of removal to file with the clerk copies of all records and proceedings relating to the claim or cause of action in the court from which the claim or cause of action was removed 3 Any party who has filed a pleading in connection with the removed claim or cause of action other than the party filing the notice of removal shall file a statement admitting or denying any allegation in the notice of removal that upon removal of the claim or cause of action the proceeding is core or non core If the statement alleges that the proceeding is non core it shall state that the party does or does not consent to entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy judge A statement required by this paragraph shall be signed pursuant to Rule 9011 and shall be filed not later than 14 days after the filing of the notice of removal Any party who files a statement pursuant to this paragraph shall mail a copy to every other party to the removed claim or cause of action f Process After Removal If one or more of the defendants has not been served with process the service has not been perfected prior to removal or the process served proves to be defective such process or service may be completed or new process issued pursuant to Part VII of these rules This subdivision shall not deprive any defendant on whom process is served after removal of the defendant s right to move to remand the case g Applicability of Part VII The rules of Part VII apply to a claim or cause of action removed to a district court from a federal or state court and govern procedure after removal Repleading is not necessary unless the court so orders In a removed action in which the defendant has not answered the defendant shall answer or present the other defenses or objections available under the rules of Part VII within 21 days following the receipt through service or otherwise of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief on which the action or proceeding is based or within 21 days following the service of summons on such initial pleading or within seven days following the filing of the notice of removal whichever period is longest h Record Supplied When a party is entitled to copies of the records and proceedings in any civil action or proceeding in a federal or a state court to be used in the removed civil action or proceeding and the clerk of the federal or state court on demand accompanied by payment or tender of the lawful fees fails to deliver certified copies the court may on affidavit reciting the facts direct such record to be supplied by affidavit or otherwise Thereupon the proceedings trial and judgment may be had in the court and all process awarded as if certified copies had been filed i Attachment or Sequestration Securities When a claim or cause of action is removed to a district court any attachment or sequestration of property in the court from which the claim or cause of action was removed shall hold the property to answer the final judgment or decree in the same manner as the property would have been held to answer final judgment or decree had it been rendered by the court from which the claim or cause of action was removed All bonds undertakings or security given by either party to the claim or cause of action prior to its removal shall remain valid and effectual notwithstanding such removal All injunctions issued orders entered and other proceedings had prior to removal shall remain in full force and effect until dissolved or modified by the court As amended Mar 30 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 30 1991 eff Aug 1 1991 Apr 29 2002 eff Dec 1 2002 Mar 26 2009 eff Dec 1 2009 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 Under 28 U S C § 1478 a any claim or cause of action in a civil action other than a proceeding before the United States Tax Court or a civil action by a Government unit to enforce [ a ] regulatory or police power may be removed if the bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction over such claim or cause of action This rule specifies how removal is accomplished the procedure thereafter and the procedure to request remand of the removed claim or cause of action If the claim or cause of action which is removed to the bankruptcy court is subject to the automatic stay of § 362 of the Code the litigation may not proceed in the bankruptcy court until relief from the stay is granted The subdivisions of this rule conform substantially to 28 U S C §§ 1446 – 1450 and Rule 81 a F R Civ P pertaining to removal to the district courts Subdivision a 1 is derived from 28 U S C § 1446 a Subdivisions a 2 and a 3 are derived from paragraphs one and two of 28 U S C § 1446 b Timely exercise of the right to remove is as important in bankruptcy cases as in removals from a state court to a district court Subdivision a 2 governs the situation in which there is litigation pending and a party to the litigation becomes a debtor under the Code Frequently removal would be of little utility in such cases because the pending litigation will be stayed by § 362 a on commencement of the case under the Code As long as the stay remains in effect there is no reason to impose a time limit for removal to the bankruptcy court and therefore clause B of subdivision a 2 provides that a removal application may be filed within 30 days of entry of an order terminating the stay Parties to stayed litigation will not be required to act immediately on commencement of a case under the Code to protect their right to remove If the pending litigation is not stayed by § 362 a of the Code the removal application must ordinarily be filed within 90 days of the order for relief Clause C contains an alternative period for a chapter 11 case If a trustee is appointed the removal application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee s qualification provided that the removal application is filed not more than 180 days after the order for relief The removal application must be filed within the longest of the three possible periods For example in a chapter 11 case if the 90 day period expires but a trustee is appointed shortly thereafter the removal application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee s qualification but not later than 180 days after the order for relief Nevertheless if the claim or cause of action in the civil action is stayed under § 362 the application may be filed after the 180 day period expires provided the application is filed within 30 days of an order terminating the stay Subdivision a 3 applies to the situation in which the case under the Code is pending when the removable claim or cause of action is asserted in a civil action initiated in other than the bankruptcy court The time for filing the application for removal begins to run on receipt of the first pleading containing the removable claim or cause of action Only litigation not stayed by the Code or by court order may properly be initiated after the case under the Code is commenced See e g § 362 a Subdivision b With one exception this subdivision is the same as 28 U S C § 1446 d The exemption from the bond requirement is enlarged to include a trustee or debtor in possession Complete exemption from the bond requirement for removal is appropriate because of the limited resources which may be available at the beginning of a case and the small probability that an action will be improperly removed Recovery on the bond is permitted only when the removal was improper If the removal is proper but the bankruptcy court orders the action remanded on equitable grounds 28 U S C § 1478 b there is no recovery on the bond Subdivisions c and d are patterned on 28 U S C § 1446 e Subdivision e There is no provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for seeking remand The first sentence of this subdivision requires that a request for remand be by motion and that the moving party serve all other parties however no hearing is required In recognition of the intrusion of the removal practice on the state and federal courts from which claims or causes of action are removed the subdivision directs the bankruptcy court to decide remand motions as soon as practicable The last sentence of this subdivision is derived from 28 U S C § 1446 c Subdivisions f and g with appropriate changes to conform them to the bankruptcy context are the same as 28 U S C § 1447 a and b and 28 U S C § 1448 respectively Subdivisions h and i are taken from Rule 81 c F R Civ P Subdivisions j and k are derived from 28 U S C § 1449 and § 1450 respectively Remand orders of bankruptcy judges are not appealable 28 U S C § 1478 b This rule does not deal with the question whether a single plaintiff or defendant may remove a claim or cause of action if there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants See 28 U S C § 1478 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment Section 1452 of title 28 with certain exceptions provides for removal of claims or causes of action in civil actions pending in state or federal courts when the claim or cause of action is within the jurisdiction conferred by 28 U S C § 1334 An order granting or denying a motion for remand is not appealable 28 U S C § 1452 b Under subdivision e as amended the district court must enter the order on the remand motion however the bankruptcy judge conducts the initial hearing on the motion and files a report and recommendation The parties may file objections Review of the report and recommendation is pursuant to Rule 9033 Subdivision f has been amended to provide that if there has been a referral pursuant to 28 U S C § 157 a the bankruptcy judge will preside over the removed civil action Subdivision i has been abrogated consistent with the abrogation of Rule 9015 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment The abrogation of subdivision b is consistent with the repeal of 28 U S C § 1446 d The changes substituting the notice of removal for the application for removal conform to the 1988 amendments to 28 U S C § 1446 Rules 7008 a and 7012 b were amended in 1987 to require parties to allege in pleadings whether a proceeding is core or non core and if non core whether the parties consent to the entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy judge Subdivision a 1 is amended and subdivision f 3 is added to require parties to a removed claim or cause of action to make the same allegations The party filing the notice of removal must include the allegation in the notice and the other parties who have filed pleadings must respond to the allegation in a separate statement filed within 10 days after removal However if a party to the removed claim or cause of action has not filed a pleading prior to removal there is no need to file a separate statement under subdivision f 3 because the allegation must be included in the responsive pleading filed pursuant to Rule 7012 b Subdivision e redesignated as subdivision d is amended to delete the restriction that limits the role of the bankruptcy court to the filing of a report and recommendation for disposition of a motion for remand under 28 U S C § 1452 b This amendment is consistent with § 309 c of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 which amended § 1452 b so that it allows an appeal to the district court of a bankruptcy court s order determining a motion for remand This subdivision is also amended to clarify that the motion is a contested matter governed by Rule 9014 The words filed with the clerk are deleted as unnecessary See Rules 5005 a and 9001 3 Committee Notes on Rules — 2002 Amendment Subdivision a 3 is amended to clarify that if a claim or cause of action is initiated after the commencement of a bankruptcy case the time limits for filing a notice of removal of the claim or cause of action apply whether the case is still pending or has been suspended dismissed or closed Changes Made After Publication and Comments No changes were made Committee Notes on Rules — 2009 Amendment The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006 a and the manner by which time is computed under the rules The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days Throughout the rules deadlines are amended in the following manner • 5 day periods become 7 day periods • 10 day periods become 14 day periods • 15 day periods become 14 day periods • 20 day periods become 21 day periods • 25 day periods become 28 day periods Rule 9028 Disability of a Judge Rule 63 F R Civ P applies in cases under the Code As amended Mar 30 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 This rule is an adaptation of Rule 63 F R Civ P Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment Rule 9028 has been changed to adopt the procedures contained in Rule 63 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for substituting a judge in the event of disability References in Text The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure referred to in text are set out in the Appendix to Title 28 Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Rule 9029 Local Bankruptcy Rules Procedure When There is No Controlling Law a Local Bankruptcy Rules 1 Each district court acting by a majority of its district judges may make and amend rules governing practice and procedure in all cases and proceedings within the district court s bankruptcy jurisdiction which are consistent with — but not duplicative of — Acts of Congress and these rules and which do not prohibit or limit the use of the Official Forms Rule 83 F R Civ P governs the procedure for making local rules A district court may authorize the bankruptcy judges of the district subject to any limitation or condition it may prescribe and the requirements of 83 F R Civ P to make and amend rules of practice and procedure which are consistent with — but not duplicative of — Acts of Congress and these rules and which do not prohibit or limit the use of the Official Forms Local rules shall conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States 2 A local rule imposing a requirement of form shall not be enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement b Procedure When There is No Controlling Law A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law these rules Official Forms and local rules of the district No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law federal rules Official Forms or the local rules of the district unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement As amended Mar 30 1987 eff Aug 1 1987 Apr 30 1991 eff Aug 1 1991 Apr 27 1995 eff Dec 1 1995 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1983 This rule is an adaptation of Rule 83 F R Civ P and Rule 57 a F R Crim P Under this rule bankruptcy courts may make local rules which govern practice before those courts Circuit councils and district courts are authorized by Rule 8018 to make local rules governing appellate practice Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1987 Amendment Rule 9029 is amended to authorize the district court to promulgate local rules governing bankruptcy practice This rule as amended permits the district court to authorize the bankruptcy judges to promulgate or recommend local rules for adoption by the district court Effective August 1 1985 Rule 83 F R Civ P governing adoption of local rules was amended to achieve greater participation by the bar scholars and the public in the rule making process to authorize the judicial council to abrogate local rules and to make certain that single judge standing orders are not inconsistent with these rules or local rules Rule 9029 has been amended to incorporate Rule 83 The term court in the last sentence of the rule includes the judges of the district court and the bankruptcy judges of the district Rule 9001 4 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Amendment This rule is amended to make it clear that the Official Forms must be accepted in every bankruptcy court Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1995 Amendment Subdivision a This rule is amended to reflect the requirement that local rules be consistent not only with applicable national rules but also with Acts of Congress The amendment also states that local rules should not repeat applicable national rules and Acts of Congress The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules conform with any uniform numbering system that may be prescribed by the Judicial Conference Lack of uniform numbering might create unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants A uniform numbering system would make it easier for an increasingly national bar and for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to a particular procedural issue Paragraph 2 of subdivision a is new Its aim is to protect against loss of rights in the enforcement of local rules relating to matters of form For example a party should not be deprived of a right to a jury trial because its attorney unaware of — or forgetting — a local rule directing that jury demands be noted in the caption of the case includes a jury demand only in the body of the pleading The proscription of paragraph 2 is narrowly drawn — covering only violations that are not willful and only those involving local rules directed to matters of form It does not limit the court s power to impose substantive penalties upon a party if it or its attorney stubbornly or repeatedly violates a local rule even one involving merely a matter of form Nor does it affect the court s power to enforce local rules that involve more than mere matters of form — for example a local rule requiring that a party demand a jury trial within a specified time period to avoid waiver of the right to a trial by jury Subdivision b This rule provides flexibility to the court in regulating practice when there is no controlling law Specifically it permits the court to regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law with rules adopted under 28 U S C § 2075 with Official Forms and with the district s local rules This rule recognizes that courts rely on multiple directives to control practice Some courts regulate practice through the published Federal Rules and the local rules of the court Some courts also have used internal operating procedures standing orders and other internal directives Although such directives continue to be authorized they can lead to problems Counsel or litigants may be unaware of various directives In addition the sheer volume of directives may impose an unreasonable barrier For example it may be difficult to obtain copies of the directives Finally counsel or litigants may be unfairly sanctioned for failing to comply with a directive For these reasons the amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or other disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such an internal directive unless the alleged violator has been furnished in a particular case with actual notice of the requirement There should be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for violating special requirements relating to practice before a particular judge unless the party or attorney has actual notice of those requirements Furnishing litigants with a copy outlining the judge s practices — or attaching instructions to a notice setting a case for conference or trial — would suffice to give actual notice as would an order in a case specifically adopting by reference a judge s standing order and indicating how copies can be obtained References in Text The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure referred to in subd a 1 are set out in the Appendix to Title 28 Judiciary and Judicial

1991 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1991 Section 307 of the Code gives the United States trustee the right to appear and be heard on issues in cases and proceedings under the Code This rule is intended to keep the United States trustee informed of certain developments and disputes in which the United States trustee may wish to be heard This rule which derives from Rule X – 1008 also enables the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case in accordance with 28 U S C § 586 a The requirement to transmit copies of certain pleadings motion papers and other documents is intended to be flexible in that the United States trustee in a particular judicial district may request copies of papers in certain categories and may request not to receive copies of documents in other categories when the practice in that district makes that desirable When the rules require that a paper be served on particular parties the time period in which service is required is also applicable to transmittal to the United States trustee Although other rules require that certain notices be transmitted to the United States trustee this rule goes further in that it requires the transmittal to the United States trustee of other papers filed in connection with these matters This rule is not an exhaustive list of the matters of which the United States trustee may be entitled to receive notice

Alabama and North Carolina until the district elects to be included in the United States trustee system or October 1 1992 whichever occurs first unless Congress extends the deadline If the United States trustee system becomes effective in these districts the transition provisions in the 1986 Act will govern the application of the United States trustee amendments to cases that are pending at that time See § 302 d 3 F The statute and not the bankruptcy court determines whether a United States trustee is authorized to act in a particular case Section 302 d 3 I of the 1986 Act authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to promulgate regulations governing the appointment of bankruptcy administrators to supervise the administration of estates and trustees in cases in the districts in Alabama and North Carolina until the provisions of the Act relating to the United States trustee take effect in these districts Pursuant to this authority in September 1987 the Judicial Conference promulgated regulations governing the selection and appointment of bankruptcy administrators and regulations governing the establishment duties and functions of bankruptcy administrators Guidelines relating to the bankruptcy administrator program have been prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts Many of these rules were amended to implement the United States trustee system in accordance with the 1986 Act Since the provisions of the 1986 Act relating to the United States trustee system are not effective in cases in Alabama and North Carolina in which a bankruptcy administrator is serving rules referring to United States trustees are at least partially inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and title 28 of the United States Code effective in such cases In determining the applicability of these rules in cases in Alabama and North Carolina in which a United States trustee is not authorized to act the following guidelines should be followed 1 The following rules do not apply because they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Code or title 28 in these cases 1002 b 1007 1 1009 c 2002 k 2007 1 b 2015 a 6 2020 3015 b 5005 b 7004 b 10 9003 b and 9034 2 The following rules are partially inconsistent with the provisions of the Code effective in these cases and therefore are applicable with the following modifications a Rule 2001 a and c — The court rather than the United States trustee appoints the interim trustee b Rule 2003 — The duties of the United States trustee relating to the meeting of creditors or equity security holders are performed by the officer determined in accordance with regulations of the Judicial Conference guidelines of the Director of the Administrative Office local rules or court orders c Rule 2007 — The court rather than the United States trustee appoints committees in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases d Rule 2008 — The bankruptcy administrator rather than the United States trustee informs the trustee of how to qualify e Rule 2009 c and d — The court rather than the United States trustee appoints interim trustees in chapter 7 cases and trustees in chapter 11 12 and 13 cases f Rule 2010 — The court rather than the United States trustee determines the amount and sufficiency of the trustee s bond g Rule 5010 — The court rather than the United States trustee appoints the trustee when a case is reopened 3 All other rules are applicable because they are consistent with the provisions of the Code and title 28 effective in these cases except that any reference to the United States trustee is not applicable and should be disregarded Many of the amendments to the rules are designed to give the United States trustee a member of the Executive Branch notice of certain developments and copies of petitions schedules pleadings and other papers In contrast the bankruptcy administrator is an officer in the Judicial Branch and matters relating to notice of developments and access to documents filed in the clerk s office are governed by regulations of the Judicial Conference of the United States guidelines of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts local rules and court orders Also requirements for disclosure of connections with the bankruptcy administrator in applications for employment of professional persons restrictions on appointments of relatives of bankruptcy administrators effects of erroneously filing papers with the bankruptcy administrator and other matters not covered by these rules may be governed by regulations of the Judicial Conference guidelines of the Director of the Administrative Office local rules and court orders This rule will cease to have effect if a United States trustee is authorized in every case in the districts in Alabama and North Carolina Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1997 Amendment Certain statutes that are not codified in title 11 or title 28 of the United States Code such as § 105 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 Pub L 103 – 394 108 Stat 4106 relate to bankruptcy administrators in the judicial districts of North Carolina and Alabama This amendment makes it clear that the Bankruptcy Rules do not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with these federal statutes GAP Report on Rule 9035 No changes to the published draft Rule 9036 Notice by Electronic Transmission Whenever the clerk or some other person as directed by the court is required to send notice by mail and the entity entitled to receive the notice requests in writing that instead of notice by mail all or part of the information required to be contained in the notice be sent by a specified type of electronic transmission the court may direct the clerk or other person to send the information by such electronic transmission Notice by electronic means is complete on transmission Added Apr 22 1993 eff Aug 1 1993 amended Apr 25 2005 eff Dec 1 2005 Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules — 1993 This rule is added to provide flexibility for banks credit card companies taxing authorities and other entities that ordinarily receive notices by mail in a large volume of bankruptcy cases to arrange to receive by electronic transmission all or part of the information required to be contained in such notices The use of electronic technology instead of mail to send information to creditors and interested parties will be more convenient and less costly for the sender and the receiver For example a bank that receives by mail at different locations notices of meetings of creditors pursuant to Rule 2002 a in thousands of cases each year may prefer to receive only the vital information ordinarily contained in such notices by electronic transmission to one computer terminal The specific means of transmission must be compatible with technology available to the sender and the receiver Therefore electronic transmission of notices is permitted only upon request of the entity entitled to receive the notice specifying the type of electronic transmission and only if approved by the court Electronic transmission pursuant to this rule completes the notice requirements The creditor or interested party is not thereafter entitled to receive the relevant notice by mail Committee Notes on Rules — 2005 Amendment The rule is amended to delete the requirement that the sender of an electronic notice must obtain electronic confirmation that the notice was received The amendment provides that notice is complete upon transmission When the rule was first promulgated confirmation of receipt of electronic notices was commonplace In the current electronic environment very few internet service providers offer the confirmation of receipt service Consequently compliance with the rule may be impossible and the rule could discourage the use of electronic noticing Confidence in the delivery of email text messages now rivals or exceeds confidence in the delivery of printed materials Therefore there is no need for confirmation of receipt of electronic messages just as there is no such requirement for paper notices Changes Made After Publication and Comment No changes since publication Rule 9037 Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court a Redacted Filings Unless the court orders otherwise in an electronic or paper filing made with the court that contains an individual s social security number taxpayer identification number or birth date the name of an individual other than the debtor known to be and identified as a minor or a financial account number a party or nonparty making the filing may include only 1 the last four digits of the social security number and taxpayer identification number 2 the year of the individual s birth 3 the minor s initials and 4 the last four digits of the financial account number b Exemptions From the Redaction Requirement The redaction requirement does not apply to the following 1 a financial account number that identifies the property allegedly subject to forfeiture in a forfeiture proceeding 2 the record of an administrative or agency proceeding unless filed with a proof of claim 3 the official record of a state court proceeding 4 the record of a court or tribunal if that record was not subject to the redaction requirement when originally filed 5 a filing covered by subdivision c of this rule and 6 a filing that is subject to § 110 of the Code c Filings Made Under Seal The court may order that a filing be made under seal without redaction The court may later unseal the filing or order the entity that made the filing to file a redacted version for the public record d For cause the court may by order in a case under the Code 1 require redaction of additional information or 2 limit or prohibit a nonparty s remote electronic access to a document filed with the court e Option for Additional Unredacted Filing Under Seal An entity making a redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under seal The court must retain the unredacted copy as part of the record f Option for Filing a Reference List A filing that contains redacted information may be filed together with a reference list that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item listed The list must be filed under seal and may be amended as of right Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be construed to refer to the corresponding item of information g Waiver of Protection of Identifiers An entity waives the protection of subdivision a as to the entity s own information by filing it without redaction and not under seal Added Apr 30 2007 eff Dec 1 2007 Committee Notes on Rules — 2007 The rule is adopted in compliance with section 205 c 3 of the E Government Act of 2002 Public Law No 107 – 347 Section 205 c 3 requires the Supreme Court to prescribe rules to protect privacy and security concerns relating to electronic filing of documents and the public availability of documents filed electronically The rule goes further than the E Government Act in regulating paper filings even when they are not converted to electronic form but the number of filings that remain in paper form is certain to diminish over time Most districts scan paper filings into the electronic case file where they become available to the public in the same way as documents initially filed in electronic form It is electronic availability not the form of the initial filing that raises the privacy and security concerns addressed in the E Government Act The rule is derived from and implements the policy adopted by the Judicial Conference in September 2001 to address the privacy concerns resulting from public access to electronic case files See http www privacy uscourts gov Policy htm The Judicial Conference policy is that documents in case files generally should be made available electronically to the same extent they are available at the courthouse provided that certain personal data identifiers are not included in the public file While providing for the public filing of some information such as the last four digits of an account number the rule does not intend to establish a presumption that this information never could or should be protected For example it may well be necessary in individual cases to prevent remote access by nonparties to any part of an account number or social security number It may also be necessary to protect information not covered by the redaction requirement — such as driver s license numbers and alien registration numbers — in a particular case In such cases protection may be sought under subdivision c or d Moreover the rule does not affect the protection available under other rules such as Rules 16 and 26 c of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or under other sources of protective authority Any personal information not otherwise protected by sealing or redaction will be made available over the internet Counsel should therefore notify clients of this fact so that an informed decision may be made on what information is to be included in a document filed with the court An individual debtor s full social security number or taxpayer identification number is included on the notice of the § 341 meeting of creditors sent to creditors Of course that is not filed with the court see Rule 1007 f the debtor submits this information and the copy of the notice that is filed with the court does not include the full social security number or taxpayer identification number Thus since the full social security number or taxpayer identification number is not filed with the court it is not available to a person searching that record The clerk is not required to review documents filed with the court for compliance with this rule As subdivision a recognizes the responsibility to redact filings rests with counsel parties and others who make filings with the court Subdivision d recognizes the court s inherent authority to issue a protective order to prevent remote access to private or sensitive information and to require redaction of material in addition to that which would be redacted under subdivision a of the rule These orders may be issued whenever necessary either by the court on its own motion or on motion of a party in interest Subdivision e allows an entity that makes a redacted filing to file an unredacted document under seal This provision is derived from section 205 c 3 iv of the E Government Act Subdivision f allows the option to file a reference list of redacted information This provision is derived from section 205 c 3 v of the E Government Act as amended in 2004 In accordance with the E Government Act subdivision f of the rule refers to redacted information The term redacted is intended to govern a filing that is prepared with abbreviated identifiers in the first instance as well as a filing in which a personal identifier is edited after its preparation Subdivision g allows an entity to waive the protections of the rule as to that entity s own information by filing it in unredacted form An entity may elect to waive the protection if for example it is determined that the costs of redaction outweigh the benefits to privacy As to financial account numbers the instructions to Schedules E and F of Official Form 6 note that the debtor may elect to include the complete account number on those schedules rather than limit the number to the final four digits Including the complete number would operate as a waiver by the debtor under subdivision g as to the full information that the debtor set out on those schedules The waiver operates only to the extent of the information that the entity filed without redaction If an entity files an unredacted identifier by mistake it may seek relief from the court Trial exhibits are subject to the redaction requirements of Rule 9037 to the extent they are filed with the court Trial exhibits that are not initially filed with the court must be redacted in accordance with this rule if and when they are filed as part of an appeal or for other reasons Changes After Publication Rule 9037 is intended to parallel as closely as possible Civil Rule 5 2 and Criminal Rule 49 1 The Advisory Committees have worked together to maintain as much consistency as possible in the three versions of the rule The rule has been revised to implement the several style revisions suggested by the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee Subdivision b was reorganized and renumbered Subdivisions b 1 and b 3 were added in response to suggestions by the Department of Justice Subdivision b 4 formerly subdivision b 2 was amended in response to the suggestion of the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management so that the subdivision now refers to court records that become a part of the record in the pending matter The term entity has been substituted for person in subdivision c and for party in subdivisions e and f to conform the rule to the definitions provided in the Bankruptcy Code [ PART X — UNITED STATES TRUSTEES ] Abrogated Apr 30 1991 eff Aug 1 1991 OFFICIAL FORMS [ The Official Forms prescribed pursuant to Rule 9009 may be found on the United States Courts website ]
