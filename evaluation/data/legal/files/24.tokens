issued by the FAR Council under sections 4 a and 7 of this order Barack Obama Memorandum of President of the United States Mar 4 2009 74 F R 9755 provided Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies The Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American taxpayers It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the taxpayers Since 2001 spending on Government contracts has more than doubled reaching over $ 500 billion in 2008 During this same period there has been a significant increase in the dollars awarded without full and open competition and an increase in the dollars obligated through cost reimbursement contracts Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008 for example dollars obligated under cost reimbursement contracts nearly doubled from $ 71 billion in 2000 to $ 135 billion in 2008 Reversing these trends away from full and open competition and toward cost reimbursement contracts could result in savings of billions of dollars each year for the American taxpayer Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole source contracts or contracts with a limited number of sources and cost reimbursement contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be spent on contracts that are wasteful inefficient subject to misuse or otherwise not well designed to serve the needs of the Federal Government or the interests of the American taxpayer Reports by agency Inspectors General the Government Accountability Office GAO and other independent reviewing bodies have shown that noncompetitive and cost reimbursement contracts have been misused resulting in wasted taxpayer resources poor contractor performance and inadequate accountability for results When awarding Government contracts the Federal Government must strive for an open and competitive process However executive agencies must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government In certain exigent circumstances agencies may need to consider whether a competitive process will not accomplish the agency s mission In such cases the agency must ensure that the risks associated with noncompetitive contracts are minimized Moreover it is essential that the Federal Government have the capacity to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight of its contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals avoid significant overcharges and curb wasteful spending A GAO study last year of 95 major defense acquisitions projects found cost overruns of 26 percent totaling $ 295 billion over the life of the projects Improved contract oversight could reduce such sums significantly Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns For decades the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government such as transportation food and maintenance Office of Management and Budget Circular A – 76 first issued in 1966 was based on the reasonable premise that while inherently governmental activities should be performed by Government employees taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars if non inherently governmental activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the forces of competition However the line between inherently governmental activities that should not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be subject to private sector competition has been blurred and inadequately defined As a result contractors may be performing inherently governmental functions Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is and is not appropriate It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive agencies shall not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in those circumstances where their use can be fully justified and where appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the taxpayer In addition there shall be a preference for fixed price type contracts Cost reimbursement contracts shall be used only when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed price type contract Moreover the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer dollars are not spent on contracts that are wasteful inefficient subject to misuse or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal Government s needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods and services being procured The Federal Government must have sufficient capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process from start to finish so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent wisely and are not subject to excessive risk Finally the Federal Government must ensure that those functions that are inherently governmental in nature are performed by executive agencies and are not outsourced I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget OMB in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration the Administrator of General Services the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and the heads of such other agencies as the Director of OMB determines to be appropriate and with the participation of appropriate management councils and program management officials to develop and issue by July 1 2009 Government wide guidance to assist agencies in reviewing and creating processes for ongoing review of existing contracts in order to identify contracts that are wasteful inefficient or not otherwise likely to meet the agency s needs and to formulate appropriate corrective action in a timely manner Such corrective action may include modifying or canceling such contracts in a manner and to the extent consistent with applicable laws regulations and policy I further direct the Director of OMB in collaboration with the aforementioned officials and councils and with input from the public to develop and issue by September 30 2009 Government wide guidance to 1 govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole source and other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of full and open competition and other competitive procurement processes 2 govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract types in full consideration of the agency s needs and to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts generally consistent with the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to section 864 of Public Law 110 – 417 3 assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the Federal acquisition workforce to develop manage and oversee acquisitions appropriately and 4 clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not appropriate consistent
