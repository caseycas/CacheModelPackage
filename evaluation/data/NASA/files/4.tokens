Subject Orbital Space Transportation Services Responsible Office Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate 1 POLICY a It is NASA s policy to 1 Encourage and facilitate a viable healthy and competitive U S commercial space transportation industry To that end NASA shall plan for and utilize commercial space transportation services using space transportation vehicles manufactured in the U S for NASA and NASA sponsored payloads to the maximum extent practicable NASA may use alternative sources of space transportation services such as a U S Government USG owned space transportation vehicle e g Space Launch System SLS or Department of Defense DoD excess Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ICBM or foreign space transportation services only after appropriate determinations and or approvals are obtained 2 Allow the use of other than commercial space transportation services if on a case by case basis and subject to any required approvals for use of foreign space transportation services the Administrator determines that one of the following exceptions applies a cost effective space transportation services that meet or can be modified to meet specific mission requirements would not be reasonably available from U S commercial providers when required or b the use of space transportation services from U S commercial providers poses an unacceptable risk of loss of a unique scientific opportunity or c after consultation with the Secretary of the Air Force the use of space transportation services from U S commercial providers is inconsistent with national security objectives or d the use of space transportation services from U S commercial providers is inconsistent with international agreements for international collaborative efforts relating to science and technology or e it is more cost effective to transport a payload in conjunction with a test or demonstration of a space transportation vehicle owned by the Federal Government 3 Not allow the use of foreign space transportation services for the launch of NASA and NASA sponsored payloads unless an exemption to the National Space Transportation Policy is coordinated through the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy a Consistent with interagency standards and coordination guidelines such an exemption is not required when NASA or NASA sponsored payloads use foreign space transportation services to support i no exchange of funds agreements

Bolden Administrator ATTACHMENT A DEFINITIONS Co manifested or dual payloads A case where two or more payloads primary payloads or a mixture of primary and secondary payloads are assigned to launch from the same launch vehicle Specific characteristics All spacecraft are accepting of the achievable orbital placement trajectory and are able to accommodate the coupled loads each causes the other All primary payload mission parties decide how to enter into and share funding for the space transportation service Cost effective space transportation service The cost effectiveness of a space transportation service is determined through a strategic best value assessment led by HEOMD The assessment can include multiple mission aspects such as unique mission requirements technical risk schedule needs inter dependencies between other government agencies and international partners current and past investments as well as the cost of the space transportation service s In the case that no U S commercial space transportation service can reasonably meet the unique requirements of the mission e g a mission requiring SLS unique capabilities then by definition no cost effective commercial space transportation service is available Foreign space transportation services Space transportation services provided by a foreign entity government or commercial company that does not meet the definition of a US commercial provider as defined in 51 U S C 50101 Hosted payload A payload comprised of one or more sensors or instruments that is attached and or integrated into a host space vehicle for the purpose of obtaining one or more ongoing resources from the host for the life of the hosted payload Specific characteristics A hosted payload s objective is typically independent of its host s objective but is dependent on the host space vehicle for one or more resources e g volume mass power communications A hosted payload typically does not drive the launch schedule or orbital placement trajectory The host space vehicle provider or owner is the lead for the space transportation service agreement Terms are negotiated but the hosted payload typically pays for its own integration onto the host space vehicle and or the marginal costs of the hosted payload s share of ongoing mission operations resources used e g power thermal data processing and communications Host space vehicle A spacecraft or other space vehicle e g a spent launch vehicle stage which is supplying one or more resources volume mass power communications etc to a hosted payload Instrument A hardware package considered a part of the payload and designed to perform a discrete function and contribute to the overall objective of the payload NASA payload A payload developed by a NASA Mission Directorate or office either in house or under contract NASA sponsored payload A payload provided by a non NASA entity under formal agreement with a NASA Mission Directorate or office e g international cooperative payloads NASA space commercialization payloads Payload A specific complement of instruments sensors equipment and support hardware carried into space to accomplish a mission or a discrete activity in outer space Specific characteristics Personnel are not considered a payload nor a part of a payload Payload sponsoring organization An office a Mission Directorate or other office within NASA Headquarters responsible for a particular NASA or NASA sponsored payload including the International Space Station and Space Communications Offices within the HEOMD Primary payload A payload that justifies its own launch Specific characteristics A primary payload typically defines the orbital placement trajectory flight design critical path of the mission integration including launch preparation process and mission operations Secondary payload A payload that is manifested subordinate to a primary payload and therefore is subordinate in launch date and orbit selection Specific characteristics A single secondary payload does not justify a dedicated launch however a launch could be justified for the flight of multiple secondaries A secondary payload is usually independent of the primary payload providing its own power and communication system but is dependent on a primary payload s launch vehicle to achieve orbit desired trajectory A secondary payload can be manifested on a mission where excess performance margin allows such an addition A secondary payload does not drive the launch mission s orbit selection flight design or mission integration critical path without agreement from the primary payload The secondary payload does not cause a launch delay without agreement from the primary payload The secondary payload must have available an appropriate fidelity mass simulator to meet the schedule needs of the primary payload should the secondary be unable to support the launch date There can be more than one secondary payload on a launch mission The primary payload s organization typically pays the majority of if not the entire space transportation service costs however a secondary payload provider typically pays for its integration costs Space transportation services For the purposes of this policy the preparation of a space transportation vehicle and its payloads for transportation to from or within outer space and the conduct of transporting a payload to from or within outer space Specific characteristics NASA typically procures commercial space transportation services Such services are considered to be a commercial item which by definition may be customarily used by the general public re 51 U S C Section 50132 and FAR 2 101 b This situation precludes the use of this term as applicable to USG owned space transportation vehicles Space transportation vehicle For the purposes of this policy any vehicle or system constructed for the purpose of operating in or transporting a payload to from or within outer space and includes any component of such vehicle not specifically designed or adapted for a payload Tertiary or auxiliary payload A payload that is lower in priority than a secondary a third order payload e g a CubeSat Specific characteristics A tertiary payload has all the same characteristics as noted above for a secondary ATTACHMENT B ACRONYMS
