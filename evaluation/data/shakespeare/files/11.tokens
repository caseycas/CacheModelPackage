When shepherds pipe on oaten straws , And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks , When turtles tread , and rooks , and daws , And maidens bleach their summer smocks , The cuckoo then , on every tree , Mocks married men ; for thus sings he , Cuckoo ; Cuckoo , cuckoo : O , word of fear , Unpleasing to a married ear !
