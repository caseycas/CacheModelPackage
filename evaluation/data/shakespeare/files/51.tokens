Noble patricians , patrons of my right , Defend the justice of my cause with arms ; And , countrymen , my loving followers , Plead my successive title with your swords : I am his first-born son that was the last That wore the imperial diadem of Rome ; Then let my father's honours live in me , Nor wrong mine age with this indignity . Romans , friends , followers , favourers of my right , If ever Bassianus , C sar's son , Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome , Keep then this passage to the Capitol , And suffer not dishonour to approach The imperial seat , to virtue consecrate , To justice , continence , and nobility ; But let desert in pure election shine , And , Romans , fight for freedom in your choice . Princes , that strive by factions and by friends Ambitiously for rule and empery , Know that the people of Rome , for whom we stand A special party , have , by common voice , In election for the Roman empery , Chosen Andronicus , surnamed Pius , For many good and great deserts to Rome : A nobler man , a braver warrior , Lives not this day within the city walls : He by the senate is accited home From weary wars against the barbarous Goths ; That , with his sons , a terror to our foes , Hath yok'd a nation , strong , train'd up in arms . Ten years are spent since first he undertook This cause of Rome , and chastised with arms Our enemies' pride : five times he hath return'd Bleeding to Rome , bearing his valiant sons In coffins from the field ; And now at last , laden with honour's spoils , Returns the good Andronicus to Rome , Renowned Titus , flourishing in arms . Let us entreat , by honour of his name , Whom worthily you would have now succeed , And in the Capitol and senate's right , Whom you pretend to honour and adore , That you withdraw you and abate your strength ; Dismiss your followers , and , as suitors should , Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness . How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts ! Marcus Andronicus , so I do affy In thy uprightness and integrity , And so I love and honour thee and thine , Thy noble brother Titus and his sons , And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all , Gracious Lavinia , Rome's rich ornament , That I will here dismiss my loving friends , And to my fortunes and the people's favour Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd . Friends , that have been thus forward in my right , I thank you all and here dismiss you all ; And to the love and favour of my country Commit myself , my person , and the cause . Rome , be as just and gracious unto me As I am confident and kind to thee . Open the gates , and let me in . Tribunes , and me , a poor competitor . Romans , make way ! the good Andronicus , Patron of virtue , Rome's best champion , Successful in the battles that he fights , With honour and with fortune is return'd From where he circumscribed with his sword , And brought to yoke , the enemies of Rome . Hail , Rome , victorious in thy mourning weeds ! Lo ! as the bark , that hath discharg'd her fraught , Returns with precious lading to the bay From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage , Cometh Andronicus , bound with laurel boughs , To re-salute his country with his tears , Tears of true joy for his return to Rome . Thou great defender of this Capitol , Stand gracious to the rites that we intend ! Romans , of five-and-twenty valiant sons , Half of the number that King Priam had , Behold the poor remains , alive , and dead ! These that survive let Rome reward with love ; These that I bring unto their latest home . With burial among their ancestors : Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword . Titus , unkind and careless of thine own , Why suffer'st thou thy sons , unburied yet To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx ? Make way to lay them by their brethren . There greet in silence , as the dead are wont , And sleep in peace , slain in your country's wars ! O sacred receptacle of my joys , Sweet cell of virtue and nobility , How many sons of mine hast thou in store , That thou wilt never render to me more ! Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths , That we may hew his limbs , and on a pile Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh , Before this earthy prison of their bones ; That so the shadows be not unappeas'd , Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth . I give him you , the noblest that survives The eldest son of this distressed queen . Stay , Roman brethren ! Gracious conqueror , Victorious Titus , rue the tears I shed , A mother's tears in passion for her son : And if thy sons were ever dear to thee , O ! think my son to be as dear to me . Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome , To beautify thy triumphs and return , Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke ; But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets For valiant doings in their country's cause ? O ! if to fight for king and commonweal Were piety in thine , it is in these . Andronicus , stain not thy tomb with blood : Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods ? Draw near them then in being merciful ; Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge : Thrice-noble Titus , spare my first-born son . Patient yourself , madam , and pardon me . These are their brethren , whom your Goths beheld Alive and dead , and for their brethren slain Religiously they ask a sacrifice : To this your son is mark'd , and die he must , To appease their groaning shadows that are gone . Away with him ! and make a fire straight ; And with our swords , upon a pile of wood , Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd . O cruel , irreligious piety ! Was ever Scythia half so barbarous ? Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome . Alarbus goes to rest , and we survive To tremble under Titus' threatening look . Then , madam , stand resolv'd ; but hope withal The self-same gods , that arm'd the Queen of Troy With opportunity of sharp revenge Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent , May favour Tamora , the Queen of Goths When Goths were Goths , and Tamora was queen To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes . See , lord and father , how we have perform'd Our Roman rites . Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd , And entrails feed the sacrificing fire , Whose smoke , like incense , doth perfume the sky . Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren , And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome . Let it be so ; and let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls . In peace and honour rest you here , my sons ; Rome's readiest champions , repose you here in rest , Secure from worldly chances and mishaps ! Here lurks no treason , here no envy swells , Here grow no damned drugs , here are no storms , No noise , but silence and eternal sleep : In peace and honour rest you here , my sons ! In peace and honour live Lord Titus long ; My noble lord and father , live in fame ! Lo ! at this tomb my tributary tears I render for my brethren's obsequies ; And at thy feet I kneel , with tears of joy Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome . O ! bless me here with thy victorious hand , Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud . Kind Rome , that hast thus lovingly reserv'd The cordial of mine age to glad my heart ! Lavinia , live ; outlive thy father's days , And fame's eternal date , for virtue's praise ! Long live Lord Titus , my beloved brother , Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome ! Thanks , gentle Tribune , noble brother Marcus . And welcome , nephews , from successful wars , You that survive , and you that sleep in fame ! Fair lords , your fortunes are alike in all , That in your country's service drew your swords ; But safer triumph is this funeral pomp , That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness , And triumphs over chance in honour's bed . Titus Andronicus , the people of Rome , Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been , Send thee by me , their tribune and their trust , This palliament of white and spotless hue ; And name thee in election for the empire , With these our late-deceased emperor's sons : Be candidatus then , and put it on , And help to set a head on headless Rome . A better head her glorious body fits Than his that shakes for age and feebleness . What should I don this robe , and trouble you ? Be chosen with proclamations to-day , To-morrow yield up rule , resign my life , And set abroad new business for you all ? Rome , I have been thy soldier forty years , And led my country's strength successfully , And buried one-and-twenty valiant sons , Knighted in field , slain manfully in arms , In right and service of their noble country . Give me a staff of honour for mine age , But not a sceptre to control the world : Upright he held it , lords , that held it last . Titus , thou shalt obtain and ask the empery . Proud and ambitious tribune , canst thou tell ? Patience , Prince Saturninus . Romans , do me right : Patricians , draw your swords , and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor . Andronicus , would thou wert shipp'd to hell , Rather than rob me of the people's hearts ! Proud Saturnine , interrupter of the good That noble-minded Titus means to thee ! Content thee , prince ; I will restore to thee The people's hearts , and wean them from themselves . Andronicus , I do not flatter thee , But honour thee , and will do till I die : My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends , I will most thankful be ; and thanks to men Of noble minds is honourable meed . People of Rome , and people's tribunes here , I ask your voices and your suffrages : Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus ? To gratify the good Andronicus , And gratulate his safe return to Rome , The people will accept whom he admits . Tribunes , I thank you ; and this suit I make , That you create your emperor's eldest son , Lord Saturnine ; whose virtues will , I hope , Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth , And ripen justice in this commonweal : Then , if you will elect by my advice , Crown him , and say , 'Long live our emperor !' With voices and applause of every sort , Patricians and plebeians , we create Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor , And say , 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine !' Titus Andronicus , for thy favours done To us in our election this day , I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts , And will with deeds requite thy gentleness : And , for an onset , Titus , to advance Thy name and honourable family , Lavinia will I make my empress , Rome's royal mistress , mistress of my heart , And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse . Tell me , Andronicus , doth this motion please thee ? It doth , my worthy lord ; and in this match I hold me highly honour'd of your Grace : And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine , King and commander of our commonweal , The wide world's emperor , do I consecrate My sword , my chariot , and my prisoners ; Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord : Receive them then , the tribute that I owe , Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet . Thanks , noble Titus , father of my life ! How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record , and , when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts , Romans , forget your fealty to me . Now , madam , are you prisoner to an emperor ; To him that , for your honour and your state , Will use you nobly and your followers . A goodly lady , trust me ; of the hue That I would choose , were I to choose anew . Clear up , fair queen , that cloudy countenance : Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer , Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome : Princely shall be thy usage every way . Rest on my word , and let not discontent Daunt all your hopes : madam , he comforts you Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths . Lavinia , you are not displeas'd with this ? Not I , my lord ; sith true nobility Warrants these words in princely courtesy . Thanks , sweet Lavinia . Romans , let us go ; Ransomless here we set our prisoners free : Proclaim our honours , lords , with trump and drum . Lord Titus , by your leave , this maid is mine . How , sir ! Are you in earnest then , my lord ? Ay , noble Titus ; and resolv'd withal To do myself this reason and this right . Suum cuique is our Roman justice : This prince in justice seizeth but his own . And that he will , and shall , if Lucius live . Traitors , avaunt ! Where is the emperor's guard ? Treason , my lord ! Lavinia is surpris'd . Surpris'd ! By whom ? By him that justly may Bear his betroth'd from all the world away . Brothers , help to convey her hence away , And with my sword I'll keep this door safe . Follow , my lord , and I'll soon bring her back . My lord , you pass not here . What ! villain boy ; Barr'st me my way in Rome ? Help , Lucius , help ! My lord , you are unjust ; and , more than so , In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son . Nor thou , nor he , are any sons of mine ; My sons would never so dishonour me . Traitor , restore Lavinia to the emperor . Dead , if you will ; but not to be his wife That is another's lawful promis'd love . No , Titus , no ; the emperor needs her not , Nor her , nor thee , nor any of thy stock : I'll trust , by leisure , him that mocks me once ; Thee never , nor thy traitorous haughty sons , Confederates all thus to dishonour me . Was none in Rome to make a stale But Saturnine ? Full well , Andronicus , Agreed these deeds with that proud brag of thine , That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands . O monstrous ! what reproachful words are these ! But go thy ways ; go , give that changing piece To him that flourish'd for her with his sword . A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy ; One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons , To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome . These words are razors to my wounded heart . And therefore , lovely Tamora , Queen of Goths , That like the stately Ph be 'mongst her nymphs , Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome , If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice , Behold , I choose thee , Tamora , for my bride , And will create thee Empress of Rome . Speak , Queen of Goths , dost thou applaud my choice ? And here I swear by all the Roman gods , Sith priest and holy water are so near , And tapers burn so bright , and every thing In readiness for Hymen us stand , I will not re-salute the streets of Rome , Or climb my palace , till from forth this place I lead espous'd my bride along with me . And here , in sight of heaven , to Rome I swear , If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths , She will a handmaid be to his desires , A loving nurse , a mother to his youth . Ascend , fair queen , Pantheon . Lords , accompany Your noble emperor , and his lovely bride , Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine , Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered : There shall we consummate our spousal rights . I am not bid to wait upon this bride . Titus , when wert thou wont to walk alone , Dishonour'd thus , and challenged of wrongs ? O ! Titus , see , O ! see what thou hast done ; In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son . No , foolish tribune , no ; no son of mine , Nor thou , nor these , confederates in the deed That hath dishonour'd all our family : Unworthy brother , and unworthy sons ! But let us give him burial , as becomes ; Give Mutius burial with our brethren . Traitors , away ! he rests not in this tomb . This monument five hundred years hath stood , Which I have sumptuously re-edified : Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors Repose in fame ; none basely slain in brawls . Bury him where you can ; he comes not here . My lord , this is impiety in you . My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him ; He must be buried with his brethren . And shall , or him we will accompany . And shall , or him we will accompany . And shall ! What villain was it spake that word ? He that would vouch it in any place but here . What ! would you bury him in my despite ? No , noble Titus ; but entreat of thee To pardon Mutius , and to bury him . Marcus , even thou hast struck upon my crest , And , with these boys , mine honour thou hast wounded : My foes I do repute you every one ; So , trouble me no more , but get you gone . He is not with himself ; let us withdraw . Not I , till Mutius' bones be buried . Brother , for in that name doth nature plead , Father , and in that name doth nature speak , Speak thou no more , if all the rest will speed . Renowned Titus , more than half my soul , Dear father , soul and substance of us all , Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue's nest , That died in honour and Lavinia's cause . Thou art a Roman ; be not barbarous : The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax That slew himself ; and wise Laertes' son Did graciously plead for his funerals . Let not young Mutius then , that was thy joy , Be barr'd his entrance here . Rise , Marcus , rise . The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw , To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome ! Well , bury him , and bury me the next . There lie thy bones , sweet Mutius , with thy friends , Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb . No man shed tears for noble Mutius ; He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause . My lord ,to step out of these dreary dumps , How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome ? I know not , Marcus ; but I know it is , Whether by device or no , the heavens can tell . Is she not , then , beholding to the man That brought her for this high good turn so far ? Yes , and will nobly him remunerate . So , Bassianus , you have play'd your prize : God give you joy , sir , of your gallant bride . And you of yours , my lord ! I say no more , Nor wish no less ; and so I take my leave . Traitor , if Rome have law or we have power , Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape . Rape call you it , my lord , to seize my own , My true-betrothed love and now my wife ? But let the laws of Rome determine all ; Meanwhile , I am possess'd of that is mine . 'Tis good , sir : you are very short with us ; But , if we live , we'll be as sharp with you . My lord , what I have done , as best I may , Answer I must and shall do with my life . Only thus much I give your Grace to know : By all the duties that I owe to Rome , This noble gentleman , Lord Titus here , Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd ; That , in the rescue of Lavinia , With his own hand did slay his youngest son , In zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath To be controll'd in that he frankly gave : Receive him then to favour , Saturnine , That hath express'd himself in all his deeds A father and a friend to thee and Rome . Prince Bassianus , leave to plead my deeds : 'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me . Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge , How I have lov'd and honour'd Saturnine ! My worthy lord , if ever Tamora Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine , Then hear me speak indifferently for all ; And at my suit , sweet , pardon what is past . What , madam ! be dishonour'd openly , And basely put it up without revenge ? Not so , my lord ; the gods of Rome forfend I should be author to dishonour you ! But on mine honour dare I undertake For good Lord Titus' innocence in all , Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs . Then , at my suit , look graciously on him ; Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose , Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart . My lord , be rul'd by me , be won at last ; Dissemble all your griefs and discontents : You are but newly planted in your throne ; Lest then , the people , and patricians too , Upon a just survey , take Titus' part , And so supplant you for ingratitude , Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin , Yield at entreats , and then let me alone . I'll find a day to massacre them all , And raze their faction and their family , The cruel father , and his traitorous sons , To whom I sued for my dear son's life ; And make them know what 'tis to let a queen Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain . Come , come , sweet emperor ; come , Andronicus ; Take up this good old man , and cheer the heart That dies in tempest of thy angry frown : Rise , Titus , rise ; my empress hath prevail'd . I thank your majesty , and her , my lord . These words , these looks , infuse new life in me . Titus , I am incorporate in Rome , A Roman now adopted happily , And must advise the emperor for his good . This day all quarrels die , Andronicus ; And let it be mine honour , good my lord , That I have reconcil'd your friends and you . For you , Prince Bassianus , I have pass'd My word and promise to the emperor , That you will be more mild and tractable . And fear not , lords , and you , Lavinia , By my advice , all humbled on your knees , You shall ask pardon of his majesty . We do ; and vow to heaven and to his highness , That what we did was mildly , as we might , Tendering our sister's honour and our own . That on mine honour here I do protest . Away , and talk not ; trouble us no more . Nay , nay , sweet emperor , we must all be friends : The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace ; I will not be denied : sweet heart , look back . Marcus , for thy sake , and thy brother's here , And at my lovely Tamora's entreats , I do remit these young men's heinous faults : Stand up . Lavinia , though you left me like a churl , I found a friend , and sure as death I swore I would not part a bachelor from the priest . Come ; if the emperor's court can feast two brides , You are my guest , Lavinia , and your friends . This day shall be a love-day , Tamora . To-morrow , an it please your majesty To hunt the panther and the hart with me , With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bon jour . Be it so , Titus , and gramercy too . Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top , Safe out of Fortune's shot ; and sits aloft , Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash , Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach . As when the golden sun salutes the morn , And , having gilt the ocean with his beams , Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach , And overlooks the highest-peering hills ; So Tamora . Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown . Then , Aaron , arm thy heart , and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress , And mount her pitch , whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held , fetter'd in amorous chains , And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus . Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts ! I will be bright , and shine in pearl and gold , To wait upon this new-made empress . To wait , said I ? to wanton with this queen , This goddess , this Semiramis , this nymph , This siren , that will charm Rome's Saturnine , And see his shipwrack and his commonweal's . Holla ! what storm is this ? Chiron , thy years want wit , thy wit wants edge And manners , to intrude where I am grac'd , And may , for aught thou know'st , affected be . Demetrius , thou dost over-ween in all And so in this , to bear me down with braves . 'Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate : I am as able and as fit as thou To serve , and to deserve my mistress' grace ; And that my sword upon thee shall approve , And plead my passions for Lavinia's love . Clubs , clubs ! these lovers will not keep the peace . Why , boy , although our mother , unadvis'd , Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side , Are you so desperate grown , to threat your friends ? Go to ; have your lath glu'd within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it . Meanwhile , sir , with the little skill I have , Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare . Ay , boy , grow ye so brave ? Why , how now , lords ! So near the emperor's palace dare you draw , And maintain such a quarrel openly ? Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge : I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns ; Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome . For shame , put up . Not I , till I have sheath'd My rapier in his bosom , and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here . For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd , Foul-spoken coward , that thunder'st with thy tongue , And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform ! Away , I say ! Now , by the gods that war-like Goths adore , This petty brabble will undo us all . Why , lords , and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a prince's right ? What ! is Lavinia then become so loose , Or Bassianus so degenerate , That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd Without controlment , justice , or revenge ? Young lords , beware ! an should the empress know This discord's ground , the music would not please . I care not , I , knew she and all the world : I love Lavinia more than all the world . Youngling , learn thou to make some meaner choice : Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope . Why , are ye mad ? or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be , And cannot brook competitors in love ? I tell you , lords , you do but plot your deaths By this device . Aaron , a thousand deaths Would I propose , to achieve her whom I love . To achieve her ! how ? Why mak'st thou it so strange ? She is a woman , therefore may be woo'd ; She is a woman , therefore may be won ; She is Lavinia , therefore must be lov'd . What , man ! more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of ; and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive , we know : Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother , Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge . Ay , and as good as Saturninus may . Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words , fair looks , and liberality ? What ! hast thou not full often struck a doe , And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose ? Why , then , it seems , some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns . Ay , so the turn were serv'd . Aaron , thou hast hit it . Would you had hit it too ! Then should not we be tir'd with this ado . Why , hark ye , hark ye ! and are you such fools To square for this ? Would it offend you then That both should speed ? Faith , not me . Nor me , so I were one . For shame , be friends , and join for that you jar : 'Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect ; and so must you resolve , That what you cannot as you would achieve , You must perforce accomplish as you may . Take this of me : Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia , Bassianus' love . A speedier course than lingering languishment Must we pursue , and I have found the path . My lords , a solemn hunting is in hand ; There will the lovely Roman ladies troop : The forest walks are wide and spacious , And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villany : Single you thither then this dainty doe , And strike her home by force , if not by words : This way , or not at all , stand you in hope . Come , come , our empress , with her sacred wit To villany and vengeance consecrate , Will we acquaint with all that we intend ; And she shall file our engines with advice , That will not suffer you to square yourselves , But to your wishes' height advance you both . The emperor's court is like the house of Fame , The palace full of tongues , of eyes , and ears : The woods are ruthless , dreadful , deaf , and dull ; There speak , and strike , brave boys , and take your turns ; There serve your lusts , shadow'd from heaven's eye , And revel in Lavinia's treasury . Thy counsel , lad , smells of no cowardice . Sit fas aut nefas , till I find the stream To cool this heat , a charm to calm these fits , Per Styga , per manes vehor . The hunt is up , the morn is bright and grey , The fields are fragrant and the woods are green . Uncouple here and let us make a bay , And wake the emperor and his lovely bride , And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal , That all the court may echo with the noise . Sons , let it be your charge , as it is ours , To attend the emperor's person carefully : I have been troubled in my sleep this night , But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd . Many good morrows to your majesty ; Madam , to you as many and as good ; I promised your Grace a hunter's peal . And you have rung it lustily , my lord ; Somewhat too early for new-married ladies . Lavinia , how say you ? I say , no ; I have been broad awake two hours and more . Come on , then ; horse and chariots let us have , And to our sport . Madam , now shall ye see Our Roman hunting . I have dogs , my lord , Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase , And climb the highest promontory top . And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way , and run like swallows o'er the plain . Chiron , we hunt not , we , with horse nor hound , But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground . He that had wit would think that I had none , To bury so much gold under a tree , And never after to inherit it . Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem , Which , cunningly effected , will beget A very excellent piece of villany : And so repose , sweet gold , for their unrest That have their alms out of the empress' chest . My lovely Aaron , wherefore look'st thou sad , When every thing doth make a gleeful boast ? The birds chant melody on every bush , The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun , The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind , And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground . Under their sweet shade , Aaron , let us sit , And , whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds , Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns , As if a double hunt were heard at once , Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise ; And after conflict , such as was suppos'd The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd , When with a happy storm they were surpris'd , And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave , We may , each wreathed in the other's arms , Our pastimes done , possess a golden slumber ; Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurse's song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep . Madam , though Venus govern your desires , Saturn is dominator over mine : What signifies my deadly-standing eye , My silence and my cloudy melancholy ; My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution ? No , madam , these are no venereal signs : Vengeance is in my heart , death in my hand , Blood and revenge are hammering in my head . Hark , Tamora , the empress of my soul , Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee , This is the day of doom for Bassianus ; His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day , Thy sons make pillage of her chastity , And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood . Seest thou this letter ? take it up , I pray thee , And give the king this fatal-plotted scroll . Now question me no more ; we are espied ; Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty , Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction . Ah ! my sweet Moor , sweeter to me than life . No more , great empress ; Bassianus comes : Be cross with him ; and I'll go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels , whatsoe'er they be . Who have we here ? Rome's royal empress , Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop ? Or is it Dian , habited like her , Who hath abandoned her holy groves , To see the general hunting in this forest ? Saucy controller of our private steps ! Had I the power that some say Dian had , Thy temples should be planted presently With horns , as was Act on's ; and the hounds Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs , Unmannerly intruder as thou art ! Under your patience , gentle empress , 'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning ; And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments . Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day ! 'Tis pity they should take him for a stag . Believe me , queen , your swarth Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his body's hue , Spotted , detested , and abominable . Why are you sequester'd from all your train , Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed , And wander'd hither to an obscure plot , Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor , If foul desire had not conducted you ? And , being intercepted in your sport , Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness . I pray you , let us hence , And let her joy her raven-colour'd love ; This valley fits the purpose passing well . The king my brother shall have note of this . Ay , for these slips have made him noted long : Good king , to be so mightily abus'd ! Why have I patience to endure all this ? How now , dear sovereign , and our gracious mother ! Why doth your highness look so pale and wan ? Have I not reason , think you , to look pale ? These two have 'tic'd me hither to this place : A barren detested vale , you see , it is ; The trees , though summer , yet forlorn and lean , O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe : Here never shines the sun ; here nothing breeds , Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven : And when they show'd me this abhorred pit , They told me , here , at dead time of the night , A thousand fiends , a thousand hissing snakes , Ten thousand swelling toads , as many urchins , Would make such fearful and confused cries , As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad , or else die suddenly . No sooner had they told this hellish tale , But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew , And leave me to this miserable death : And then they called me foul adulteress , Lascivious Goth , and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect ; And , had you not by wondrous fortune come , This vengeance on me had they executed . Revenge it , as you love your mother's life , Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children . This is a witness that I am thy son . And this for me , struck home to show my strength . Ay , come , Semiramis , nay , barbarous Tamora ; For no name fits thy nature but thy own . Give me thy poniard ; you shall know , my boys , Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong . Stay , madam ; here is more belongs to her : First thrash the corn , than after burn the straw . This minion stood upon her chastity , Upon her nuptial vow , her loyalty , And with that painted hope she braves your mightiness : And shall she carry this unto her grave ? An if she do , I would I were an eunuch . Drag hence her husband to some secret hole , And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust . But when ye have the honey ye desire , Let not this wasp outlive , us both to sting . I warrant you , madam , we will make that sure . Come , mistress , now perforce we will enjoy That nice-preserved honesty of yours . O Tamora ! thou bear'st a woman's face , I will not hear her speak ; away with her ! Sweet lords , entreat her hear me but a word . Listen , fair madam : let it be your glory To see her tears ; but be your heart to them As unrelenting flint to drops of rain . When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam ? O ! do not learn her wrath ; she taught it thee ; The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble ; Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny . Yet every mother breeds not sons alike : Do thou entreat her show a woman pity . What ! wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard ? 'Tis true ! the raven doth not hatch a lark : Yet have I heard , O ! could I find it now , The lion mov'd with pity did endure To have his princely paws par'd all away . Some say that ravens foster forlorn children , The whilst their own birds famish in their nests : O ! be to me , though thy hard heart say no , Nothing so kind , but something pitiful . I know not what it means ; away with her ! O , let me teach thee ! for my father's sake , That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee , Be not obdurate , open thy deaf ears . Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me , Even for his sake am I pitiless . Remember , boys , I pour'd forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice ; But fierce Andronicus would not relent : Therefore , away with her , and use her as you will : The worse to her , the better lov'd of me . O Tamora ! be call'd a gentle queen , And with thine own hands kill me in this place ; For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long ; Poor I was slain when Bassianus died . What begg'st thou then ? fond woman , let me go . 'Tis present death I beg ; and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell . O ! keep me from their worse than killing lust , And tumble me into some loathsome pit , Where never man's eye may behold my body : Do this , and be a charitable murderer . So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee : No , let them satisfy their lust on thee . Away ! for thou hast stay'd us here too long . No grace ! no womanhood ! Ah , beastly creature , The blot and enemy to our general name . Confusion fall Nay , then I'll stop your mouth . Bring thou her husband : This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him . Farewell , my sons : see that you make her sure . Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed Till all the Andronici be made away . Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor , And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower . Come on , my lords , the better foot before : Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleep . My sight is very dull , whate'er it bodes . And mine , I promise you : were't not for shame , Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile . What ! art thou fall'n ? What subtle hole is this , Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers , Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood As fresh as morning's dew distill'd on flowers ? A very fatal place it seems to me . Speak , brother , hast thou hurt thee with the fall ? O brother ! with the dismall'st object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament . Now will I fetch the king to find them here , That he thereby may give a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother . Why dost not comfort me , and help me out From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole ? I am surprised with an uncouth fear ; A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints : My heart suspects more than mine eye can see . To prove thou hast a true-divining heart , Aaron and thou look down into this den , And see a fearful sight of blood and death . Aaron is gone ; and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise . O ! tell me how it is ; for ne'er till now Was I a child , to fear I know not what . Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here , All on a heap , like to a slaughter'd lamb , In this detested , dark , blood-drinking pit . If it be dark , how dost thou know 'tis he ? Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring , that lightens all the hole , Which , like a taper in some monument , Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks , And shows the ragged entrails of the pit : So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood . O brother ! help me with thy fainting hand , If fear hath made thee faint , as me it hath , Out of this fell devouring receptacle , As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth . Reach me thy hand , that I may help thee out ; Or , wanting strength to do thee so much good I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit , poor Bassianus' grave . I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink . Nor I no strength to climb without thy help . Thy hand once more ; I will not loose again , Till thou art here aloft , or I below . Thou canst not come to me : I come to thee . Along with me : I'll see what hole is here , And what he is that now is leap'd into it . Say , who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth ? The unhappy son of old Andronicus ; Brought hither in a most unlucky hour , To find thy brother Bassianus dead . My brother dead ! I know thou dost but jest : He and his lady both are at the lodge , Upon the north side of this pleasant chase ; 'Tis not an hour since I left him there . We know not where you left him all alive ; But , out alas ! here have we found him dead . Where is my lord , the king ? Here , Tamora ; though griev'd with killing grief . Where is thy brother Bassianus ? Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound : Poor Bassianus here lies murdered . Then all too late I bring this fatal writ , The complot of this timeless tragedy ; And wonder greatly that man's face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny . And if we miss to meet him handsomely , Sweet huntsman , Bassianus 'tis we mean , Do thou so much as dig the grave for him : Thou know'st our meaning . Look for thy reward Among the nettles at the elder-tree Which overshades the mouth of that same pit Where we decreed to bury Bassianus : Do this , and purchase us thy lasting friends . O Tamora ! was ever heard the like ? This is the pit , and this the elder-tree . Look , sirs , if you can find the huntsman out That should have murder'd Bassianus here . My gracious lord , here is the bag of gold . Two of thy whelps , fell curs of bloody kind , Have here bereft my brother of his life . Sirs , drag them from the pit unto the prison : There let them bide until we have devis'd Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them . What ! are they in this pit ? O wondrous thing ! How easily murder is discovered ! High emperor , upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed ; That this fell fault of my accursed sons , Accursed , if the fault be prov'd in them , If it be prov'd ! you see it is apparent . Who found this letter ? Tamora , was it you ? Andronicus himself did take it up . I did , my lord : yet let me be their bail ; For , by my father's reverend tomb , I vow They shall be ready at your highness' will To answer their suspicion with their lives . Thou shalt not bail them : see thou follow me . Some bring the murder'd body , some the murderers : Let them not speak a word ; the guilt is plain ; For , by my soul , were there worse end than death , That end upon them should be executed . Andronicus , I will entreat the king : Fear not thy sons , they shall do well enough . Come , Lucius , come ; stay not to talk with them . So , now go tell , an if thy tongue can speak , Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee . Write down thy mind , bewray thy meaning so ; An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe . See , how with signs and tokens she can scrowl . Go home , call for sweet water , wash thy hands . She hath no tongue to call , nor hands to wash ; And so let's leave her to her silent walks . An 'twere my case , I should go hang myself . If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord . Who's this ? my niece , that flies away so fast ? Cousin , a word ; where is your husband ? If I do dream , would all my wealth would wake me ! If I do wake , some planet strike me down , That I may slumber in eternal sleep ! Speak , gentle niece , what stern ungentle hands Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare Of her two branches , those sweet ornaments , Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in , And might not gain so great a happiness As have thy love ? Why dost not speak to me ? Alas ! a crimson river of warm blood , Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind , Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips , Coming and going with thy honey breath . But , sure , some Tereus hath deflower'd thee , And , lest thou shouldst detect him , cut thy tongue . Ah ! now thou turn'st away thy face for shame ; And , notwithstanding all this loss of blood , As from a conduit with three issuing spouts , Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face Blushing to be encounter'd with a cloud . Shall I speak for thee ? shall I say 'tis so ? O ! that I knew thy heart ; and knew the beast , That I might rail at him to ease my mind . Sorrow concealed , like to an oven stopp'd , Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is . Fair Philomela , she but lost her tongue , And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind : But , lovely niece , that mean is cut from thee ; A craftier Tereus hast thou met withal , And he hath cut those pretty fingers off , That could have better sew'd than Philomel . O ! had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble , like aspen-leaves , upon a lute , And make the silken strings delight to kiss them , He would not , then , have touch'd them for his life ; Or had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made , He would have dropp'd his knife , and fell asleep , As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet . Come , let us go , and make thy father blind ; For such a sight will blind a father's eye : One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads ; What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes ? Do not draw back , for we will mourn with thee : O ! could our mourning ease thy misery . Hear me , grave fathers ! noble tribunes , stay ! For pity of mine age , whose youth was spent In dangerous wars , whilst you securely slept ; For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed ; For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd ; And for these bitter tears , which now you see Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks ; Be pitiful to my condemned sons , Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought . For two and twenty sons I never wept , Because they died in honour's lofty bed . For these , these , tribunes , in the dust I write My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears . Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite ; My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush . O earth ! I will befriend thee more with rain , That shall distil from these two ancient urns , Than youthful April shall with all his showers : In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still ; In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow , And keep eternal spring-time on thy face , So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood . O reverend tribunes ! O gentle , aged men ! Unbind my sons , reverse the doom of death : And let me say , that never wept before , My tears are now prevailing orators . O noble father , you lament in vain : The tribunes hear you not , no man is by ; And you recount your sorrows to a stone . Ah ! Lucius , for thy brothers let me plead . Grave tribunes , once more I entreat of you , My gracious lord , no tribune hears you speak . Why , 'tis no matter , man : if they did hear , They would not mark me , or if they did mark , They would not pity me , yet plead I must , All bootless unto them . Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones , Who , though they cannot answer my distress , Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes , For that they will not intercept my tale . When I do weep , they humbly at my feet Receive my tears , and seem to weep with me ; And , were they but attired in grave weeds , Rome could afford no tribune like to these . A stone is soft as wax , tribunes more hard than stones ; A stone is silent , and offendeth not , And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death . But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn ? To rescue my two brothers from their death ; For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd My everlasting doom of banishment . O happy man ! they have befriended thee . Why , foolish Lucius , dost thou not perceive That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers ? Tigers must prey ; and Rome affords no prey But me and mine : how happy art thou then , From these devourers to be banished ! But who comes with our brother Marcus here ? Titus , prepare thy aged eyes to weep ; Or , if not so , thy noble heart to break : I bring consuming sorrow to thine age . Will it consume me ? let me see it then . This was thy daughter . Why , Marcus , so she is . Ay me ! this object kills me . Faint-hearted boy , arise , and look upon her . Speak , Lavinia , what accursed hand Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight ? What fool hath added water to the sea , Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy ? My grief was at the height before thou cam'st ; And now , like Nilus , it disdaineth bounds . Give me a sword , I'll chop off my hands too ; For they have fought for Rome , and all in vain ; And they have nurs'd this woe , in feeding life ; In bootless prayer have they been held up , And they have serv'd me to effectless use : Now all the service I require of them Is that the one will help to cut the other . 'Tis well , Lavinia , that thou hast no hands , For hands , to do Rome service , are but vain . Speak , gentle sister , who hath martyr'd thee ? O ! that delightful engine of her thoughts , That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence , Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage , Where , like a sweet melodious bird , it sung Sweet varied notes , enchanting every ear . O ! say thou for her , who hath done this deed ? O ! thus I found her straying in the park , Seeking to hide herself , as doth the deer , That hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound . It was my dear ; and he that wounded her Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead : For now I stand as one upon a rock Environ'd with a wilderness of sea , Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave , Expecting ever when some envious surge Will in his brinish bowels swallow him . This way to death my wretched sons are gone ; Here stands my other son , a banish'd man , And here my brother , weeping at my woes : But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn , Is dear Lavinia , dearer than my soul . Had I but seen thy picture in this plight It would have madded me : what shall I do Now I behold thy lively body so ? Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears , Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee : Thy husband he is dead , and for his death Thy brothers are condemn'd , and dead by this . Look ! Marcus ; ah ! son Lucius , look on her : When I did name her brothers , then fresh tears Stood on her cheeks , as doth the honey-dew Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd . Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband ; Perchance because she knows them innocent . If they did kill thy husband , then be joyful , Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them . No , no , they would not do so foul a deed ; Witness the sorrow that their sister makes . Gentle Lavinia , let me kiss thy lips ; Or make some sign how I may do thee ease . Shall thy good uncle , and thy brother Lucius , And thou , and I , sit round about some fountain , Looking all downwards , to behold our cheeks How they are stain'd , like meadows yet not dry , With miry alime left on them by a flood ? And in the fountain shall we gaze so long Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness , And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears ? Or shall we cut away our hands , like thine ? Or shall we bite our tongues , and in dumb shows Pass the remainder of our hateful days ? What shall we do ? let us , that have our tongues , Plot some device of further misery , To make us wonder'd at in time to come . Sweet father , cease your tears ; for at your grief See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps . Patience , dear niece . Good Titus , dry thine eyes . Ah ! Marcus , Marcus , brother ; well I wot Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine , For thou , poor man , hast drown'd it with thine own . Ah ! my Lavinia , I will wipe thy cheeks . Mark , Marcus , mark ! I understand her signs : Had she a tongue to speak , now would she say That to her brother which I said to thee : His napkin , with his true tears all bewet , Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks . O ! what a sympathy of woe is this ; As far from help as limbo is from bliss . Titus Andronicus , my lord the emperor Sends thee this word : that , if thou love thy sons , Let Marcus , Lucius , or thyself , old Titus , Or any one of you , chop off your hand , And send it to the king : he for the same Will send thee hither both thy sons alive ; And that shall be the ransom for their fault . O gracious emperor ! O gentle Aaron ! Did ever raven sing so like a lark , That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise ? With all my heart , I'll send the emperor my hand : Good Aaron , wilt thou help to chop it off ? Stay , father ! for that noble hand of thine , That hath thrown down so many enemies , Shall not be sent ; my hand will serve the turn : My youth can better spare my blood than you ; And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives . Which of your hands hath not defended Rome , And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe , Writing destruction on the enemy's castle ? O ! none of both but are of high desert : My hand hath been but idle ; let it serve To ransom my two nephews from their death ; Then have I kept it to a worthy end . Nay , come , agree whose hand shall go along , For fear they die before their pardon come . My hand shall go . By heaven , it shall not go ! Sirs , strive no more : such wither'd herbs as these Are meet for plucking up , and therefore mine . Sweet father , if I shall be thought thy son , Let me redeem my brothers both from death . And for our father's sake , and mother's care , Now let me show a brother's love to thee . Agree between you ; I will spare my hand . Then I'll go fetch an axe . But I will use the axe . Come hither , Aaron ; I'll deceive them both : Lend me thy hand , and I will give thee mine . If that be call'd deceit , I will be honest , And never , whilst I live , deceive men so : But I'll deceive you in another sort , And that you'll say , ere half an hour pass . Now stay your strife : what shall be is dispatch'd . Good Aaron , give his majesty my hand : Tell him it was a hand that warded him From thousand dangers ; bid him bury it ; More hath it merited ; that let it have . As for my sons , say I account of them As jewels purchas'd at an easy price ; And yet dear too , because I bought mine own . I go , Andronicus ; and for thy hand , Look by and by to have thy sons with thee . Their heads , I mean . O ! how this villany Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it . Let fools do good , and fair men call for grace , Aaron will have his soul black like his face . O ! here I lift this one hand up to heaven , And how this feeble ruin to the earth : If any power pities wretched tears , To that I call ! What ! wilt thou kneel with me ? Do , then , dear heart ; for heaven shall hear our prayers , Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim , And stain the sun with fog , as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosoms . O ! brother , speak with possibilities , And do not break into these deep extremes . Is not my sorrow deep , having no bottom ? Then be my passions bottomless with them . But yet let reason govern thy lament . If there were reason for these miseries , Then into limits could I bind my woes . When heaven doth weep , doth not the earth o'erflow ? If the winds rage , doth not the sea wax mad , Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoln face ? And wilt thou have a reason for this coil ? I am the sea ; hark ! how her sighs do blow ; She is the weeping welkin , I the earth : Then must my sea be moved with her sighs ; Then must my earth with her continual tears Become a deluge , overflow'd and drown'd ; For why my bowels cannot hide her woes , But like a drunkard must I vomit them . Then give me leave , for losers will have leave To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues . Worthy Andronicus , ill art thou repaid For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor . Here are the heads of thy two noble sons , And here's thy hand , in scorn to thee sent back : Thy griefs their sports , thy resolution mock'd ; That woe is me to think upon thy woes , More than remembrance of my father's death . Now let hot tna cool in Sicily , And be my heart an ever burning hell ! These miseries are more than may be borne . To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal , But sorrow flouted at is double death . Ah ! that this sight should make so deep a wound , And yet detested life not shrink thereat , That ever death should let life bear his name , Where life hath no more interest but to breathe . Alas ! poor heart ; that kiss is comfortless As frozen water to a starved snake . When will this fearful slumber have an end ? Now , farewell , flattery : die , Andronicus ; Thou dost not slumber : see , thy two sons' heads , Thy war-like hand , thy mangled daughter here ; Thy other banish'd son , with this dear sight Struck pale and bloodless ; and thy brother , I , Even like a stony image , cold and numb . Ah ! now no more will I control thy griefs . Rent off thy silver hair , thy other hand Gnawing with thy teeth ; and be this dismal sight The closing up of our most wretched eyes ! Now is a time to storm ; why art thou still ? Ha , ha , ha ! Why dost thou laugh ? it fits not with this hour . Why , I have not another tear to shed : Besides , this sorrow is an enemy , And would usurp upon my watery eyes , And make them blind with tributary tears : Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave ? For these two heads do seem to speak to me , And threat me I shall never come to bliss Till all these mischiefs be return'd again Even in their throats that have committed them . Come , let me see what task I have to do . You heavy people , circle me about , That I may turn me to each one of you , And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs . The vow is made . Come , brother , take a head ; And in this hand the other will I bear . Lavinia , thou shalt be employ'd in these things : Bear thou my hand , sweet wench , between thy teeth . As for thee , boy , go get thee from my sight ; Thou art an exile , and thou must not stay : Hie to the Goths , and raise an army there : And if you love me , as I think you do , Let's kiss and part , for we have much to do . Farewell , Andronicus , my noble father ; The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome : Farewell , proud Rome ; till Lucius come again , He leaves his pledges dearer than his life . Farewell , Lavinia , my noble sister ; O ! would thou wert as thou tofore hast been ; But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives But in oblivion and hateful griefs . If Lucius live , he will requite your wrongs , And make proud Saturnine and his empress Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen . Now will I to the Goths , and raise a power , To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine . So , so ; now sit ; and look you eat no more Than will preserve just so much strength in us As will revenge these bitter woes of ours . Marcus , unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot : Thy niece and I , poor creatures , want our hands , And cannot passionate our ten-fold grief With folded arms . This poor right hand of mine Is left to tyrannize upon my breast ; And when my heart , all mad with misery , Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh , Then thus I thump it down . Thou map of woe , that thus dost talk in signs ! When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still . Wound it with sighing , girl , kill it with groans ; Or get some little knife between thy teeth , And just against thy heart make thou a hole ; That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall May run into that sink , and , soaking in , Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears . Fie , brother , fie ! teach her not thus to lay Such violent hands upon her tender life . How now ! has sorrow made thee dote already ? Why , Marcus , no man should be mad but I . What violent hands can she lay on her life ? Ah ! wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands ; To bid aeas tell the tale twice o'er , How Troy was burnt and he made miserable ? O ! handle not the theme , to talk of hands , Lest we remember still that we have none . Fie , fie ! how franticly I square my talk , As if we should forget we had no hands , If Marcus did not name the word of hands . Come , let's fall to ; and , gentle girl , eat this : Here is no drink . Hark , Marcus , what she says ; I can interpret all her martyr'd signs : She says she drinks no other drink but tears , Brew'd with her sorrow , mash'd upon her cheeks . Speechless complainer , I will learn thy thought ; In thy dumb action will I be as perfect As begging hermits in their holy prayers : Thou shalt not sigh , nor hold thy stumps to heaven , Nor wink , nor nod , nor kneel , nor make a sign , But I of these will wrest an alphabet , And by still practice learn to know thy meaning . Good grandsire , leave these bitter deep laments : Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale . Alas ! the tender boy , in passion mov'd , Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness . Peace , tender sapling ; thou art made of tears , And tears will quickly melt thy life away . What dost thou strike at , Marcus , with thy knife ? At that that I have kill'd , my lord ; a fly . Out on thee , murderer ! thou kill'st my heart ; Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny : A deed of death , done on the innocent , Becomes not Titus' brother . Get thee gone ; I see , thou art not for my company . Alas ! my lord , I have but kill'd a fly . But how if that fly had a father and a mother ? How would he hang his slender gilded wings And buzz lamenting doings in the air ! Poor harmless fly , That , with his pretty buzzing melody , Came here to make us merry ! and thou hast kill'd him . Pardon me , sir ; it was a black ill-favour'd fly , Like to the empress' Moor ; therefore I kill'd him .
