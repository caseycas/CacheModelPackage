If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it ! how , in stripping it , You more invest it ! Ebbing men , indeed , Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth . Prithee , say on : The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee , and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield . Thus , sir : Although this lord of weak remembrance , this Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd , hath here almost persuaded , For he's a spirit of persuasion , only Professes to persuade ,the king , his son's alive , 'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd As he that sleeps here swims . I have no hope That he's undrown'd . O ! out of that 'no hope What great hope have you ! no hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond , But doubts discovery there . Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drown'd ? He's gone . Then tell me Who's the next heir of Naples ? Claribel . She that is Queen of Tums ; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man's life ; she that from Naples Can have no note , unless the sun were post The man i' th' moon's too slow till new-born chins Be rough and razorable : she that , from whom ? We all were sea-swallow'd , though some cast again , And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what's past is prologue , what to come In yours and my discharge . What stuff is this !How say you ? 'Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis ; So is she heir of Naples ; 'twixt which regions There is some space . A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out , 'How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples ?Keep in Tunis , And let Sebastian wake !' Say , this were death That now hath seiz'd them ; why , they were no worse Than now they are . There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps ; lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo ; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat . O , that you bore The mind that I do ! what a sleep were this For your advancement ! Do you understand me ? Methinks I do . And how does your content Tender your own good fortune ? I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero . True : And look how well my garments sit upon me ; Much feater than before ; my brother's servants Were then my fellows ; now they are my men . But , for your conscience , Ay , sir ; where lies that ? if it were a kibe , 'Twould put me to my slipper ; but I feel not This deity in my bosom : twenty consciences , That stand 'twixt me and Milan , candied be they , And melt ere they molest ! Here lies your brother , No better than the earth he lies upon , If he were that which now he's like , that's dead ; Whom I , with this obedient steel ,three inches of it , Can lay to bed for ever ; whiles you , doing thus , To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel , this Sir Prudence , who Should not upbraid our course . For all the rest , They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk ; They'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour . Thy case , dear friend , Shall be my precedent : as thou got'st Milan , I'll come by Naples . Draw thy sword : one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou pay'st , And I the king shall love thee . Draw together ; And when I rear my hand , do you the like , To fall it on Gonzalo . O ! but one word . My master through his art foresees the danger That you , his friend , are in ; and sends me forth For else his project dies to keep thee living . While you here do snoring lie , Open-ey'd Conspiracy His time doth take . If of life you keep a care , Shake off slumber , and beware Awake ! awake ! Then let us both be sudden . Now , good angels Preserve the king ! Why , how now ! ho , awake ! Why are you drawn ? Wherefore this ghastly looking ? What's the matter ? Whiles we stood here securing your repose , Even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls , or rather hons ; did't not wake you ? It struck mine ear most terribly . I heard nothing . O ! 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear , To make an earthquake : sure it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions . Heard you this , Gonzalo ? Upon mine honour , sir , I heard a humming , And that a strange one too , which did awake me . I shak'd you , sir , and cry'd ; as mine eyes open'd , I saw their weapons drawn :there was a noise , That's verily . 'Tis best we stand upon our guard , Or that we quit this place : let's draw our weapons . Lead off this ground , and let's make further search For my poor son . Heavens keep him from these beasts ! For he is , sure , i' the island . Lead away . Prospero my lord shall know what I have done : So , king , go safely on to seek thy son . All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs , fens , flats , on Prosper fall , and make him By inch-meal a disease ! His spirits hear me , And yet I needs must curse . But they'll nor pinch , Fright me with urchin-shows , pitch me i' the mire , Nor lead me , like a firebrand , in the dark Out of my way , unless he bid 'em ; but For every trifle are they set upon me : Sometime like apes , that mow and chatter at me And after bite me ; then like hedge-hogs , which Lie tumbling in my bare-foot way and mount Their pricks at my foot-fall ; sometime am I All wound with adders , who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness . Lo now ! lo ! Here comes a spirit of his , and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly : I'll fall flat ; Perchance he will not mind me . Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all , and another storm brewing ; I hear it sing i' the wind : yond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor . If it should thunder as it did before , I know not where to hide my head : yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls .What have we here ? a man or a fish ? Dead or alive ? A fish : he smells like a fish ; a very ancient and fish-like smell ; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John . A strange fish ! Were I in England now ,as once I was ,and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver : there would this monster make a man ; any strange beast there makes a man . When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian . Legg'd like a man ! and his fins like arms ! Warm , o' my troth ! I do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer ; this is no fish , but an islander , that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt . Alas ! the storm is come again : my best way is to creep under his gaberdine ; there is no other shelter hereabout : misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows . I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past . I shall no more to sea , to sea , Here shall I die a-shore : This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral : Well , here's my comfort . The master , the swabber , the boatswain and I , The gunner and his mate , Lov'd Mall , Meg , and Marian and Margery , But none of us car'd for Kate ; For she had a tongue with a tang , Would cry to a sailor , 'Go hang !' She lov'd not the savour of tar nor of pitch , Yet a tailor might scratch her where-e'er she did itch : Then to sea , boys , and let her go hang . This is a scurvy tune too : but here's my comfort . Do not torment me : O ! What's the matter ? Have we devils here ? Do you put tricks upon us with savages and men of Ind ? Ha ! I have not 'scaped drowning , to be afeard now of your four legs ; for it hath been said , As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground : and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at's nostrils . The spirit torments me : O ! This is some monster of the isle with four legs , who hath got , as I take it , an ague . Where the devil should he learn our language ? I will give him some relief , if it be but for that : if I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him , he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's-leather . Do not torment me , prithee : I'll bring my wood home faster . He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest . He shall taste of my bottle : if he have never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit . If I can recover him , and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him : he shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly . Thou dost me yet but little hurt ; thou wilt anon , I know it by thy trembling : now Prosper works upon thee . Come on your ways : open your mouth ; here is that which will give language to you , cat . Open your mouth : this will shake your shaking , I can tell you , and that soundly : you cannot tell who's your friend ; open your chaps again . I should know that voice : it should be but he is drowned , and these are devils . O ! defend me . Four legs and two voices ; a most delicate monster ! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend ; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches , and to detract . If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague . Come . Amen ! I will pour some in thy other mouth . Stephano ! Doth thy other mouth call me ? Mercy ! mercy ! This is a devil , and no monster : I will leave him ; I have no long spoon . Stephano !if thou beest Stephano , touch me , and speak to me ; for I am Trinculo :be not afeard thy good friend Trinculo . If thou beest Trinculo , come forth . I'll pull thee by the lesser legs : if any be Trinculo's legs , these are they . Thou art very Trinculo indeed ! How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf ? Can he vent Trinculos ? I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke . But art thou not drowned , Stephano ? I hope now thou art not drowned . Is the storm overblown ? I hid me under the dead mooncalf's gaberdine for fear of the storm . And art thou living , Stephano ? O Stephano ! two Neapolitans 'scaped ! Prithee , do not turn me about : my stomach is not constant . These be fine things an if they be not sprites . That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor : I will kneel to him . How didst thou 'scape ? How cam'st thou hither ? swear by this bottle , how thou cam'st hither . I escaped upon a butt of sack , which the sailors heaved overboard , by this bottle ! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands , since I was cast ashore . I'll swear upon that bottle , to be thy true subject ; for the liquor is not earthly . Here : swear then , how thou escapedst . Swam ashore , man , like a duck : I can swim like a duck , I'll be sworn . Here , kiss the book . Though thou canst swim like a duck , thou art made like a goose . O Stephano ! hast any more of this ? The whole butt , man : my cellar is in a rock by the seaside , where my wine is hid . How now , moon-calf ! how does thine ague ? Hast thou not dropped from heaven ? Out o the moon , I do assure thee : I was the man in the moon , when time was . I have seen thee in her , and I do adore thee ; my mistress showed me thee , and thy dog , and thy bush . Come , swear to that ; kiss the book ; I will furnish it anon with new contents ; swear . By this good light , this is a very shallow monster .I afeard of him !a very weak monster .The man i' the moon ! a most poor credulous monster !Well drawn , monster , in good sooth . I'll show thee every fertile inch o' the island ; And I will kiss thy foot . I prithee , be my god . By this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster : when his god's asleep , he'll rob his bottle . I'll kiss thy foot : I'll swear myself thy subject . Come on then ; down , and swear . I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster . A most scurvy monster ! I could find in my heart to beat him , Come , kiss . But that the poor monster's in drink : an abominable monster ! I'll shew thee the best springs ; I'll pluck thee berries ; I'll fish for thee , and get thee wood enough . A plague upon the tyrant that I serve ! I'll bear him no more sticks , but follow thee , Thou wondrous man . A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard ! I prithee , let me bring thee where crabs grow ; And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts ; Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmozet ; I'll bring thee To clust'ring filberts , and sometimes I'll get thee Young scamels from the rock . Wilt thou go with me ? I prithee now , lead the way , without any more talking .Trinculo , the king and all our company else being drowned , we will inherit here .Here ; bear my bottle .Fellow Trinculo , we'll fill him by and by again . Farewell , master ; farewell , farewell A howling monster , a drunken monster . No more dams I'll make for fish , Nor fetch in firing At requiring , Nor scrape trenchering , nor wash dish , 'Ban , 'Ban , Ca Caliban , Has a new master Get a new man . Freedom , high-day ! high-day , freedom ! freedom ! high-day , freedom ! O brave monster ! lead the way . There be some sports are painful , and their labour Delight in them sets off : some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone , and most poor matters Point to rich ends . This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious ; but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labours pleasures : O ! she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed , And he's compos'd of harshness . I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction : my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work , and says such baseness Had never like executor . I forget : But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours , Most busiest when I do it . Alas ! now , pray you , Work not so hard : I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile ! Pray , set it down and rest you : when this burns , 'Twill weep for having wearied you . My father Is hard at study ; pray now , rest yourself : He's safe for these three hours . O most dear mistress , The sun will set , before I shall discharge What I must strive to do . If you'll sit down , I'll bear your logs the while . Pray , give me that ; I'll carry it to the pile . No , precious creature : I had rather crack my sinews , break my back , Than you should such dishonour undergo , While I sit lazy by . It would become me As well as it does you : and I should do it With much more ease ; for my good will is to it , And yours it is against . Poor worm ! thou art infected : This visitation shows it . You look wearily . No , noble mistress ; 'tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night . I do beseech you Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers What is your name ? Miranda .O my father ! I have broke your hest to say so . Admir'd Miranda ! Indeed , the top of admiration ; worth What's dearest to the world ! Full many a lady I have ey'd with best regard , and many a time The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear : for several virtues Have I lik'd several women ; never any With so full soul but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd , And put it to the foil : but you , O you ! So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature's best . I do not know One of my sex ; no woman's face remember , Save , from my glass , mine own ; nor have I seen More that I may call men than you , good friend , And my dear father : how features are abroad , I am skill-less of ; but , by my modesty , The jewel in my dower ,I would not wish Any companion in the world but you ; Nor can imagination form a shape , Besides yourself , to like of . But I prattle Something too wildly and my father's precepts I therein do forget . I am in my condition A prince , Miranda ; I do think , a king ; I would not so !and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth .Hear my soul speak : The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service ; there resides , To make me slave to it ; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man . Do you love me ? O heaven ! O earth ! bear witness to this sound , And crown what I profess with kind event If I speak true : if hollowly , invert What best is boded me to mischief ! I , Beyond all limit of what else i' the world , Do love , prize , honour you . I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of . Fair encounter Of two most rare affections ! Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between them ! Wherefore weep you ? At mine unworthiness , that dare not offer What I desire to give ; and much less take What I shall die to want . But this is trifling ; And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows . Hence , bashful cunning ! And prompt me , plain and holy innocence ! I am your wife , if you will marry me ; If not , I'll die your maid : to be your fellow You may deny me ; but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no . My mistress , dearest ; And I thus humble ever . My husband then ? Ay , with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom : here's my hand . And mine , with my heart in't : and now farewell Till half an hour hence . A thousand thousand ! So glad of this as they , I cannot be , Who are surpris'd withal ; but my rejoicing At nothing can be more . I'll to my book ; For yet , ere supper time , must I perform Much business appertaining . Tell not me :when the butt is out , we will drink water ; not a drop before : therefore bear up , and board 'em .Servant-monster , drink to me . Servant-monster ! the folly of this island ! They say there's but five upon this isle : we are three of them ; if th' other two be brained like us , the state totters . Drink , servant-monster , when I bid thee : thy eyes are almost set in thy head . Where should they be set else ? he were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail . My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack : for my part , the sea cannot drown me ; I swam , ere I could recover the shore , five-and-thirty leagues , off and on , by this light . Thou shalt be my lieutenant , monster , or my standard . Your lieutenant , if you list ; he's no standard . We'll not run , Monsieur monster . Nor go neither : but you'll lie , like dogs ; and yet say nothing neither . Moon-calf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good moon-calf . How does thy honour ? Let me lick thy shoe . I'll not serve him , he is not valiant . Thou hest , most ignorant monster : I am in case to justle a constable . Why , thou deboshed fish thou , was there ever a man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day ? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie , being but half a fish and half a monster ? Lo , how he mocks me ! wilt thou let him , my lord ? 'Lord' quoth he !that a monster should be such a natural ! Lo , lo , again ! bite him to death , I prithee . Trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head : if you prove a mutineer , the next tree ! The poor monster's my subject , and he shall not suffer indignity . I thank my noble lord . Wilt thou be pleas'd To hearken once again the suit I made thee ? Marry , will I ; kneel , and repeat it : I will stand , and so shall Trinculo . As I told thee before , I am subject to a tyrant , a sorcerer , that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island . Thou liest . Thou liest , thou jesting monkey thou ; I would my valiant master would destroy thee ; I do not lie . Trinculo , if you trouble him any more in his tale , by this hand , I will supplant some of your teeth . Why , I said nothing . Mum then and no more . Proceed . I say , by sorcery he got this isle ; From me he got it : if thy greatness will , Revenge it on him ,for , I know , thou dar'st ; But this thing dare not , That's most certain . Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee . How now shall this be compassed ? Canst thou bring me to the party ? Yea , yea , my lord : I'll yield him thee asleep , Where thou may'st knock a nail into his head . Thou liest ; thou canst not . What a pied ninny's this ! Thou scurvy patch ! I do beseech thy greatness , give him blows , And take his bottle from him : when that's gone He shall drink nought but brine ; for I'll not show him Where the quick freshes are . Trinculo , run into no further danger : interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I'll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a stock-fish of thee . Why , what did I ? I did nothing . I'll go further off . Didst thou not say he hed ? Thou liest . Do I so ? take thou that . As you like this , give me the lie another time . I did not give thee the he :Out o' your wits and hearing too ?A pox o' your bottle ! this can sack and drinking do .A murrain on your monster , and the devil take your fingers ! Ha , ha , ha ! Now , forward with your tale .Prithee stand further off . Beat him enough : after a little time I'll beat him too . Stand further .Come , proceed . Why , as I told thee , 'tis a custom with him I' the afternoon to sleep : there thou may'st brain him , Having first seiz'd his books ; or with a log Batter his skull , or paunch him with a stake , Or cut his wezand with thy knife . Remember First to possess his books ; for without them He's but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command : they all do hate him As rootedly as I . Burn but his books ; He has brave utensils ,for so he calls them , Which , when he has a house , he'll deck withal : And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter ; he himself Calls her a nonpareil : I never saw a woman , But only Sycorax my dam and she ; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least . Is it so brave a lass ? Ay , lord ; she will become thy bed , I warrant , And bring thee forth brave brood . Monster , I will kill this man : his daughter and I will be king and queen ,save our graces ! and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys . Dost thou like the plot , Trinculo ? Excellent . Give me thy hand : I am sorry I beat thee ; but , while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head . Within this half hour will he be asleep ; Wilt thou destroy him then ? Ay , on mine honour . This will I tell my master . Thou mak'st me merry : I am full of pleasure . Let us be jocund : will you troll the catch You taught me but while-ere ? At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason : Come on , Trinculo , let us sing . Flout 'em , and scout 'em ; and scout 'em , and flout 'em ; Thought is free . That's not the tune . What is this same ? This is the tune of our catch , played by the picture of Nobody . If thou beest a man , show thyself in thy likeness : if thou beest a devil , take't as thou list . O , forgive me my sins ! He that dies pays all debts : I defy thee .Mercy upon us ! Art thou afeard ? No , monster , not I . Be not afeard : the isle is full of noises , Sounds and sweet airs , that give delight , and hurt not . Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears ; and sometime voices , That , if I then had wak'd after long sleep , Will make mesleep again : and then , in dreaming , The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me ; that , when I wak'd I cried to dream again . This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing . When Prospero is destroyed . That shall be by and by : I remember the story . The sound is going away : let's follow it , and after do our work . Lead , monster ; we'll follow .I would I could see this taborer ! he lays it on . Wilt come ? I'll follow , Stephano . By'r lakin , I can go no further , sir ; My old bones ache : here's a maze trod indeed , Through forth-rights , and meanders ! by your patience , I needs must rest me . Old lord , I cannot blame thee , Who am myself attach'd with weariness , To the dulling of my spirits : sit down , and rest . Even here I will put off my hope , and keep it No longer for my flatterer : he is drown'd Whom thus we stray to find ; and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land . Well , let him go . I am right glad that he's so out of hope . Do not , for one repulse , forego the purpose That you resolv'd to effect . The next advantage Will we take throughly . Let it be to-night ; For , now they are oppress'd with travel , they Will not , nor cannot , use such vigilance As when they are fresh . I say to-night : no more . What harmony is this ? my good friends , hark ! Marvellous sweet music ! Give us kind keepers , heavens ! What were these ? A living drollery . Now I will believe That there are unicorns ; that in Arabia There is one tree , the ph nix' throne ; one ph nix At this hour reigning there . I'll believe both ; And what does else want credit , come to me , And I'll be sworn 'tis true : travellers ne'er did lie , Though fools at home condemn them . If in Naples I should report this now , would they believe me ? If I should say I saw such islanders , For , certes , these are people of the island , Who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet , note , Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many , nay , almost any . Honest lord , Thou hast said well ; for some of you there present Are worse than devils . I cannot too much muse , Such shapes , such gesture , and such sound , expressing , Although they want the use of tongue ,a kind Of excellent dumb discourse . Praise in departing . They vanish'd strangely . No matter , since They have left their viands behind ; for we have stomachs . Will't please you to taste of what is here ? Not I . Faith , sir , you need not fear . When we were boys , Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dew-lapp'd like bulls , whose throats had hanging at them Wallets of flesh ? or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts ? which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of . I will stand to and feed , Although my last ; no matter , since I feel The best is past .Brother , my lord the duke , Stand to and do as we . You are three men of sin , whom Destiny That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in't ,the never-surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you ; and on this island Where man doth not inhabit ; you 'mongst men Being most unfit to live . I have made you mad ; And even with such-like valour men hang and drown Their proper selves . You fools ! I and my fellows Are ministers of fate : the elements Of whom your swords are temper'd , may as well Wound the loud winds , or with bemock'd-at stabs Kill the still-closing waters , as diminish One dowle that's in my plume ; my fellow-ministers Are like invulnerable . If you could hurt , Your swords are now too massy for your strengths , And will not be uplifted . But , remember , For that's my business to you ,that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero ; Expos'd unto the sea , which hath requit it , Him and his innocent child : for which foul deed The powers , delaying , not forgetting , have Incens'd the seas and shores , yea , all the creatures , Against your peace . Thee of thy son , Alonso , They have bereft ; and do pronounce , by me , Lingering perdition ,worse than any death Can be at once ,shall step by step attend You and your ways ; whose wraths to guard you from Which here in this most desolate isle , else falls Upon your heads ,is nothing but heart-sorrow And a clear life ensuing . Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Perform'd , my Ariel ; a grace it had , devouring : Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say : so , with good life And observation strange , my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done . My high charms work , And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions : they now are in my power ; And in these fits I leave them , while I visit Young Ferdinand ,whom they suppose is drown'd , And his and mine lov'd darling . I the name of something holy , sir , why stand you In this strange stare ? O , it is monstrous ! monstrous ! Methought the billows spoke and told me of it ; The winds did sing it to me ; and the thunder , That deep and dreadful organ-pipe , pronounc'd The name of Prosper : it did bass my trespass . Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded ; and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded , And with him there lie mudded . But one fiend at a time , I'll fight their legions o'er . I'll be thy second . All three of them are desperate ; their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now 'gins to bite the spirits .I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to . Follow , I pray you . If I have too austerely punish'd you , Your compensation makes amends ; for I Have given you here a third of mine own life , Or that for which I live ; whom once again I tender to thy hand : all thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love , and thou Hast strangely stood the test : here , afore Heaven , I ratify this my rich gift . O Ferdinand ! Do not smile at me that I boast her off , For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise , And make it halt behind her . I do believe it Against an oracle . Then , as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchas'd , take my daughter : but If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be minister'd , No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow ; but barren hate , Sour-ey'd disdain and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both : therefore take heed , As Hymen's lamps shall light you . As I hope For quiet days , fair issue and long life , With such love as 'tis now , the murkiest den , The most opportune place , the strong'st sug gestion Our worser genius can , shall never melt Mine honour into lust , to take away The edge of that day's celebration When I shall think , or Ph bus' steeds are founder'd , Or Night kept chain'd below . Fairly spoke : Sit then , and talk with her , she is thine own . What , Ariell my industrious servant Ariell What would my potent master ? here I am . Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform ; and I must use you In such another trick . Go bring the rabble , O'er whom I give thee power , here to this place : Incite them to quick motion ; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art : it is my promise , And they expect it from me . Presently ? Ay , with a twink . Before you can say , 'Come ,' and 'Go ,' And breathe twice ; and cry , 'so , so ,' Each one , tripping on his toe , Will be here with mop and mow . Do you love me , master ? no ? Dearly my delicate Ariel . Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call . Well , I conceive . Look , thou be true ; do not give dalliance Too much the rein : the strongest oaths are straw To the fire i' the blood : be more abstemious , Or else good night your vow ! I warrant you , sir ; The white-cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver . Well . Now come , my Ariel ! bring a corollary , Rather than want a spirit : appear , and pertly . No tongue ! all eyes ! be silent . Ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas Of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats , and peas ; Thy turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , And flat meads thatch'd with stover , them to keep ; Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims , Which spongy April at thy hest betrims , To make cold nymphs chaste crowns ; and thy broom groves , Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves , Being lass-lorn ; thy pole-clipt vineyard ; And thy sea-marge , sterile and rocky-hard , Where thou thyself dost air : the queen o' the sky , Whose watery arch and messenger am I , Bids thee leave these ; and with her sovereign grace , Here on this grass-plot , in this very place , To come and sport ; her peacocks fly amain : Approach , rich Ceres , her to entertain . Hail , many-colour'd messenger , that ne'er Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter ; Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey-drops , refreshing showers : And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres , and my unshrubb'd down , Rich scarf to my proud earth ; why hath thy queen Summon'd me hither , to this short-grass'd green ? A contract of true love to celebrate , And some donation freely to estate On the bless'd lovers . Tell me , heavenly bow , If Venus or her son , as thou dost know , Do now attend the queen ? since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company I have forsworn . Of her society Be not afraid ; I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son Dove-drawn with her . Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are , that no bed-rite shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted ; but in vain : Mars's hot minion is return'd again ; Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows , Swears he will shoot no more , but play with sparrows , And be a boy right out . Highest queen of state , Great Juno comes ; I know her by her gait . How does my bounteous sister ? Go with me To bless this twain , that they may prosperous be , And honour'd in their issue . Honour , riches , marriage-blessing , Long continuance , and increasing , Hourly joys be still upon you ! Juno sings her blessings on you . Earth's increase , foison plenty , Barns and garners never empty : Vines , with clust'ring bunches growing ; Plants with goodly burden bowing ; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest ! Scarcity and want shall shun you ; Ceres' blessing so is on you . This is a most majestic vision , and Harmonious charmingly : May I be bold To think these spirits ? Spirits , which by mine art I have from their confines call'd to enact My present fancies . Let me live here ever : So rare a wonder'd father and a wise , Makes this place Paradise . Sweet , now , silence ! Juno and Ceres whisper seriously , There's something else to do : hush , and be mute , Or else our spell is marr'd . You nymphs , call'd Naiades , of the windring brooks , With your sedg'd crowns , and ever-harmless looks , Leave your crisp channels , and on this green land Answer your summons : Juno does command . Come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate A contract of true love : be not too late . You sun-burn'd sicklemen , of August weary , Come hither from the furrow , and be merry : Make holiday : your rye-straw hats put on , And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing . I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban , and his confederates Against my life : the minute of their plot Is almost come . Well done ! avoid ; no more ! This is strange : your father's in some passion That works him strongly . Never till this day Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd . You do look , my son , in a mov'd sort , As if you were dismay'd : be cheerful , sir : Our revels now are ended . These our actors , As I foretold you , were all spirits and Are melted into air , into thin air : And , like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud-capp'd towers , the gorgeous palaces , The solemn temples , the great globe itself , Yea , all which it inherit , shall dissolve And , like this insubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a rack behind . We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .Sir , I am vex'd : Bear with my weakness ; my old brain is troubled . Be not disturb'd with my infirmity . If you be pleas'd , retire into my cell And there repose : a turn or two I'll walk , To still my beating mind . We wish your peace . Come with a thought ! I thank thee : Ariel , come ! Thy thoughts I cleave to . What's thy pleasure ? Spirit , We must prepare to meet with Caliban . Ay , my commander ; when I presented Ceres , I thought to have told thee of it ; but I fear'd Lest I might anger thee . Say again , where didst thou leave these varlets ? I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking ; So full of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces ; beat the ground For kissing of their feet ; yet always bending Towards their project . Then I beat my tabor ; At which , like unback'd colts , they prick'd their ears , Advanc'd their eyelids , lifted up their noses As they smelt music : so I charm'd their ears That , calf-like , they my lowing follow'd through Tooth'd briers , sharp furzes , pricking goss and thorns , Which enter'd their frail shins : at last I left them I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell , There dancing up to the chins , that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet . This was well done , my bird . Thy shape invisible retain thou still : The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither , For stale to catch these thieves . I go , I go . A devil , a born devil , on whose nature Nurture can never stick ; on whom my pains , Humanely taken , are all lost , quite lost ; And as with age his body uglier grows , So his mind cankers . I will plague them all , Even to roaring . Come , hang them on this line . Pray you , tread softly , that the blind mole may not Hear a foot fall : we now are near his cell . Monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the Jack with us . Monster , I do smell all horse-piss ; at which my nose is in great indignation . So is mine .Do you hear , monster ? If I should take a displeasure against you , look you , Thou wert but a lost monster . Good my lord , give me thy favour still : Be patient , for the prize I'll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance : therefore speak softly ; All's hush'd as midnight yet . Ay , but to lose our bottles in the pool , There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that , monster , but an infinite loss . That's more to me than my wetting : yet this is your harmless fairy , monster . I will fetch off my bottle , though I be o'er ears for my labour . Prithee , my king , be quiet . Seest thou here , This is the mouth o' the cell : no noise , and enter . Do that good mischief , which may make this island Thine own for ever , and I , thy Caliban , For aye thy foot-licker . Give me thy hand : I do begin to have bloody thoughts . O king Stephano ! O peer ! O worthy Stephano ! look , what a wardrobe here is for thee ! Let it alone , thou fool ; it is but trash . O , ho , monster ! we know what belongs to a frippery .O king Stephano ! Put off that gown , Trinculo ; by this hand , I'll have that gown . Thy grace shall have it . The dropsy drown this fooll what do you mean To dote thus on such luggage ? Let's along , And do the murder first : if he awake , From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches ; Make us strange stuff . Be you quiet , monster .Mistress line , is not this my jerkin ? Now is the jerkin under the line : now , jerkin , you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin . Do , do : we steal by line and level , an't like your grace . I thank thee for that jest ; here's a garment for't : wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country : 'Steal by line and level ,' is an excellent pass of pate ; there's another garment for't . Monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest . I will have none on't : we shall lose our time , And all be turn'd to barnacles , or to apes With foreheads villanous low . Monster , lay-to your fingers : help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or I'll turn you out of my kingdom . Go to ; carry this . And this . Ay , and this . Hey , Mountain , hey ! Silver ! there it goes , Silver ! Fury , Fury ! there , Tyrant , there ! hark , hark ! Go , charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions ; shorten up their sinews With aged cramps , and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard , or cat o' mountain . Hark ! they roar . Let them be hunted soundly . At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies : Shortly shall all my labours end , and thou Shalt have the air at freedom : for a little , Follow , and do me service . Now does my project gather to a head : My charms crack not ; my spirits obey , and time Goes upright with his carriage . How's the day ? On the sixth hour ; at which time , my lord , You said our work should cease . I did say so , When first I rais'd the tempest . Say , my spirit , How fares the king and's followers ? Confin'd together In the same fashion as you gave in charge , Just as you left them : all prisoners , sir , In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell ; They cannot budge till your release . The king , His brother , and yours , abide all three distracted , And the remainder mourning over them , Brimful of sorrow and dismay ; but chiefly Him , that you term'd , sir , 'The good old lord Gonzalo :' His tears run down his beard , like winter's drops From eaves of reeds ; your charm so strongly works them , That if you now beheld them , your affections Would become tender . Dost thou think so , spirit ? Mine would , sir , were I human . And mine shall . Hast thou , which art but air , a touch , a feeling Of their afflictions , and shall not myself , One of their kind , that relish all as sharply , Passion as they , be kindlier mov'd than thou art ? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick , Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury Do I take part : the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance : they being penitent , The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further . Go , release them , Ariel . My charms I'll break , their senses I'll restore , And they shall be themselves . I'll fetch them , sir Ye elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes , and groves ; And ye , that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back ; you demi-puppets , that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make Whereof the ewe not bites ; and you , whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms ; that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew ; by whose aid , Weak masters though ye be I have bedimm'd The noontide sun , call'd forth the mutinous winds , And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault Set roaring war : to the dread-rattling thunder Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt : the strong-bas'd promontory Have I made shake ; and by the spurs pluck'd up The pine and cedar : graves at my command Have wak'd their sleepers , op'd , and let them forth By my so potent art . But this rough magic I here abjure ; and , when I have requir'd Some heavenly music ,which even now I do , To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for , I'll break my staff , Bury it certain fathoms in the earth , And , deeper than did ever plummet sound , I'll drown my book . A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy , cure thy brains , Now useless , boil'd within thy skull ! There stand , For you are spell-stopp'd . Holy Gonzalo , honourable man , Mine eyes , even sociable to the show of thine , Fall fellowly drops . The charm dissolves apace ; And as the morning steals upon the night , Melting the darkness , so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason .O good Gonzalo ! My true preserver , and a loyal sir To him thou follow'st , I will pay thy graces Home , both in word and deed .Most cruelly Didst thou , Alonso , use me and my daughter : Thy brother was a furtherer in the act ; Thou'rt pinch'd for't now , Sebastian .Flesh and blood , You , brother mine , that entertain'd ambition , Expell'd remorse and nature ; who , with Sebastian , Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong , Would here have kill'd your king ; I do forgive thee , Unnatural though thou art !Their understanding Begins to swell , and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shores That now lie foul and muddy . Not one of them That yet looks on me , or would know me .Ariel , Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell : I will discase me , and myself present , As I was sometime Milan .Quickly , spirit ; Thou shalt ere long be free . Where the bee sucks , there suck I In a cowslip's bell I he : There I couch when owls do cry . On the bat's back I do fly After summer merrily Merrily , merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough Why , that's my dainty Ariel ! I shall miss thee ; But yet thou shalt have freedom ;so , so , so . To the king's ship , invisible as thou art : There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches ; the master and the boatswain Being awake , enforce them to this place , And presently , I prithee . I drink the air before me , and return Or e'er your pulse twice beat . All torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement Inhabits here : some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country ! Behold , sir king , The wronged Duke of Milan , Prospero . For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee , I embrace thy body ; And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome . Whe'r thou beest he or no , Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me , As late I have been , I not know : thy pulse Beats , as of flesh and blood ; and , since I saw thee , Th' affliction of my mind amends , with which , I fear , a madness held me : this must crave , An if this be at all a most strange story . Thy dukedom I resign , and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs .But how should Prospero Be living , and be here ? First , noble friend , Let me embrace thine age ; whose honour cannot Be measur'd , or confin'd . Whether this be , Or be not , I'll not swear . You do yet taste Some subtilties o' the isle , that will not let you Believe things certain .Welcome ! my friends all : But you , my brace of lords , were I so minded , I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you , And justify you traitors : at this time I will tell no tales . The devil speaks in him . No . For you , most wicked sir , whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth , I do forgive Thy rankest fault ; all of them ; and require My dukedom of thee , which , perforce , I know , Thou must restore . If thou beest Prospero , Give us particulars of thy preservation ; How thou hast met us here , who three hours since Were wrack'd upon this shore ; where I have lost , How sharp the point of this remembrance is ! My dear son Ferdinand . I am woe for't , sir . Irreparable is the loss , and patience Says it is past her cure . I rather think You have not sought her help ; of whose soft grace , For the like loss I have her sovereign aid , And rest myself content . You the like loss ! As great to me , as late ; and , supportable To make the dear loss , have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter . A daughter ? O heavens ! that they were living both in Naples , The king and queen there ! that they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies . When did you lose your daughter ? In this last tempest . I perceive , these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason , and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth , their words Are natural breath : but , howsoe'er you have Been justled from your senses , know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan ; who most strangely Upon this shore , where you were wrack'd , was landed , To be the lord on't . No more yet of this ; For 'tis a chronicle of day by day , Not a relation for a breakfast nor Befitting this first meeting . Welcome , sir ; This cell's my court : here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad : pray you , look in . My dukedom since you have given me again , I will requite you with as good a thing ; At least bring forth a wonder , to content ye As much as me my dukedom . Sweet lord , you play me false . No , my dearest love , I would not for the world . Yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , And I would call it fair play . If this prove A vision of the island , one dear son Shall I twice lose . A most high miracle ! Though the seas threaten , they are merciful : I have curs'd them without cause . Now , all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about ! Arise , and say how thou cam'st here . O , wonder ! How many goodly creatures are there here ! How beauteous mankind is ! O brave new world , That has such people in't ! 'Tis new to thee . What is this maid , with whom thou wast at play ? Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours : Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us , And brought us thus together ? Sir , she is mortal ; But by immortal Providence she's mine ; I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice , nor thought I had one . She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan , Of whom so often I have heard renown , But never saw before ; of whom I have Receiv'd a second life ; and second father This lady makes him to me . I am hers : But O ! how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness ! There , sir , stop : Let us not burden our remembrances With a heaviness that's gone . I have inly wept , Or should have spoke ere this . Look down , you gods , And on this couple drop a blessed crown ; For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way Which brought us hither ! I say , Amen , Gonzalo ! Was Milan thrust from Milan , that his issue Should become kings of Naples ? O , rejoice Beyond a common joy , and set it down With gold on lasting pillars . In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis , And Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife Where he himself was lost ; Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle ; and all of us ourselves , When no man was his own . Give me your hands : Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy ! Be it so : Amen ! O look , sir ! look , sir ! here are more of us . I prophesied , if a gallows were on land , This fellow could not drown .Now , blasphemy , That swear'st grace o'erboard , not an oath on shore ? Hast thou no mouth by land ? What is the news ? The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company : the next , our ship , Which but three glasses since we gave out split , Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when We first put out to sea . Sir , all this service Have I done since I went . My tricksy spirit ! These are not natural events ; they strengthen From strange to stranger .Say , how came you hither ? If I did think , sir , I were well awake , I'd strive to tell you . We were dead of sleep , And ,how we know not ,all clapp'd under hatches , Where , but even now , with strange and several noises Of roaring , shrieking , howling , jingling chains , And mo diversity of sounds , all horrible , We were awak'd ; straightway , at liberty : Where we , in all her trim , freshly beheld Our royal , good , and gallant ship ; our master Capering to eye her : on a trice , so please you , Even in a dream , were we divided from them , And were brought moping hither . Was't well done ? Bravely , my diligence ! Thou shalt be free . This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod ; And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of : some oracle Must rectify our knowledge . Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business : at pick'd leisure Which shall be shortly , single I'll resolve you , Which to you shall seem probable ,of every These happen'd accidents ; till when , be cheerful , And think of each thing well . Come hither , spirit ; Set Caliban and his companions free ; Untie the spell . How fares my gracious sir ? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not . Every man shift for all the rest , and let no man take care for himself , for all is but fortune .Coragio ! bully-monster , Coragio ! If these be true spies which I wear in my head , here's a goodly sight . O Setebos ! these be brave spirits , indeed . How fine my master is ! I am afraid He will chastise me . Ha , ha ! What things are these , my lord Antonio ? Will money buy them ? Very like ; one of them Is a plain fish , and , no doubt , marketable . Mark but the badges of these men , my lords , Then say , if they be true .This mis-shapen knave , His mother was a witch ; and one so strong That could control the moon , make flows and ebbs , And deal in her command without her power . These three have robb'd me ; and this demidevil , For he's a bastard one ,had plotted with them To take my life : two of these fellows you Must know and own ; this thing of darkness I Acknowledge mine . I shall be pinch'd to death Is not this Stephano , my drunken butler ? He is drunk now : where had he wine ? And Trinculo is reeling-ripe : where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded them ? How cam'st thou in this pickle ? I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that , I fear me , will never out of my bones : I shall not fear fly-blowing . Why , how now , Stephano ! O ! touch me not : I am not Stephano , but a cramp . You'd be king of the isle , sirrah ? I should have been a sore one then . This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on . He is as disproportion'd in his manners As in his shape .Go , sirrah , to my cell ; Take with you your companions : as you look To have my pardon , trim it handsomely . Ay , that I will ; and I'll be wise hereafter , And seek for grace . What a thrice-double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god , And worship this dull fool ! Go to ; away ! Hence , and bestow your luggage where you found it . Or stole it , rather . Sir , I invite your highness and your train To my poor cell , where you shall take your rest For this one night ; which part of it I'll waste With such discourse as , I not doubt , shall make it Go quick away ; the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle : and in the morn I'll bring you to your ship , and so to Naples , Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-beloved solemniz'd ; And thence retire me to my Milan , where Every third thought shall be my grave . I long To hear the story of your life , which must Take the ear strangely . I'll deliver all ; And promise you calm seas , auspicious gales And sail so expeditious that shall catch Your royal fleet far off . My Ariel , chick , That is thy charge : then to the elements Be free , and fare thou well !Please you , draw near . Now my charms are all o'erthrown , And what strength I have's mine own ; Which is most faint : now , 'tis true , I must be here confin'd by you , Or sent to Naples Let me not , Since I have my dukedom got And pardon'd the deceiver , dwell In this bare island by your spell ; But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands . Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill , or else my project fails , Which was to please . Now I want Spirits to enforce , art to enchant ; And my ending is despair , Unless I be reliev'd by prayer , Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults . As you from crimes would pardon'd be , Let your indulgence set me free .
