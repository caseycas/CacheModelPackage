Now , fair Hippolyta , our nuptial hour Draws on apace : four happy days bring in Another moon ; but O ! methinks how slow This old moon wanes ; she lingers my desires , Like to a step dame , or a dowager Long withering out a young man's revenue . Four days will quickly steep themselves in night ; Four nights will quickly dream away the time ; And then the moon , like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven , shall behold the night Of our solemnities . Go , Philostrate , Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments ; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; Turn melancholy forth to funerals ; The pale companion is not for our pomp . Hippolyta , I woo'd thee with my sword , And won thy love doing thee injuries ; But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . Happy be Theseus , our renowned duke ! Thanks , good Egeus : what's the news with thee ? Full of vexation come I , with complaint Against my child , my daughter Hermia . Stand forth , Demetrius . My noble lord , This man hath my consent to marry her . Stand forth , Lysander : and , my gracious duke , This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child : Thou , thou , Lysander , thou hast given her rimes , And interchang'd love-tokens with my child ; Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , With feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth ; With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart ; Turn'd her obedience , which is due to me , To stubborn harshness . And , my gracious duke , Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius , I beg the ancient privilege of Athens , As she is mine , I may dispose of her ; Which shall be either to this gentleman , Or to her death , according to our law Immediately provided in that case . What say you , Hermia ? be advis'd , fair maid . To you , your father should be as a god ; One that compos'd your beauties , yea , and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted , and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it . Demetrius is a worthy gentleman . So is Lysander . In himself he is ; But , in this kind , wanting your father's voice , The other must be held the worthier . I would my father look'd but with my eyes . Rather your eyes must with his judgment look . I do entreat your Grace to pardon me . I know not by what power I am made bold , Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts ; But I beseech your Grace , that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case , If I refuse to wed Demetrius . Either to die the death , or to abjure For ever the society of men . Therefore , fair Hermia , question your desires ; Know of your youth , examine well your blood , Whe'r , if you yield not to your father's choice , You can endure the livery of a nun , For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd , To live a barren sister all your life , Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon . Thrice blessed they that master so their blood , To undergo such maiden pilgrimage ; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd , Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows , lives , and dies , in single blessedness . So will I grow , so live , so die , my lord , Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship , whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty . Take time to pause ; and , by the next new moon , The sealing-day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship , Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will , Or else to wed Demetrius , as he would ; Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life . Relent , sweet Hermia ; and , Lysander , yield Thy crazed title to my certain right . You have her father's love , Demetrius ; Let me have Hermia's : do you marry him . Scornful Lysander ! true , he hath my love , And what is mine my love shall render him ; And she is mine , and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius . I am , my lord , as well deriv'd as he , As well possess'd ; my love is more than his ; My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd If not with vantage , as Demetrius' ; And , which is more than all these boasts can be , I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia . Why should not I then prosecute my right ? Demetrius , I'll avouch it to his head , Made love to Nedar's daughter , Helena , And won her soul ; and she , sweet lady , dotes , Devoutly dotes , dotes in idolatry , Upon this spotted and inconstant man . I must confess that I have heard so much , And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof ; But , being over-full of self-affairs , My mind did lose it . But , Demetrius , come ; And come , Egeus ; you shall go with me , I have some private schooling for you both . For you , fair Hermia , look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father's will , Or else the law of Athens yields you up , Which by no means we may extenuate , To death , or to a vow of single life . Come , my Hippolyta : what cheer , my love ? Demetrius and Egeus , go along : I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial , and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves . With duty and desire we follow you . How now , my love ! Why is your cheek so pale ? How chance the roses there do fade so fast ? Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes . Ay me ! for aught that ever I could read , Could ever hear by tale or history , The course of true love never did run smooth ; But , either it was different in blood , O cross ! too high to be enthrall'd to low . Or else misgraffed in respect of years , O spite ! too old to be engag'd to young . Or else it stood upon the choice of friends , O hell ! to choose love by another's eye . Or , if there were a sympathy in choice , War , death , or sickness did lay siege to it , Making it momentany as a sound , Swift as a shadow , short as any dream , Brief as the lightning in the collied night , That , in a spleen , unfolds both heaven and earth , And ere a man hath power to say , 'Behold !' The jaws of darkness do devour it up : So quick bright things come to confusion . If then true lovers have been ever cross'd , It stands as an edict in destiny : Then let us teach our trial patience , Because it is a customary cross , As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs , Wishes and tears , poor fancy's followers . A good persuasion : therefore , hear me , Hermia . I have a widow aunt , a dowager Of great revenue , and she hath no child : From Athens is her house remote seven leagues ; And she respects me as her only son . There , gentle Hermia , may I marry thee , And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us . If thou lov'st me then , Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night , And in the wood , a league without the town , Where I did meet thee once with Helena , To do observance to a morn of May , There will I stay for thee . My good Lysander ! I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow , By his best arrow with the golden head , By the simplicity of Venus' doves , By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves , And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen , When the false Troyan under sail was seen , By all the vows that ever men have broke , In number more than ever women spoke , In that same place thou hast appointed me , To-morrow truly will I meet with thee . Keep promise , love . Look , here comes Helena . God speed fair Helena ! Whither away ? Call you me fair ? that fair again unsay . Demetrius loves your fair : O happy fair ! Your eyes are lode-stars ! and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear , When wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear . Sickness is catching : O ! were favour so , Yours would I catch , fair Hermia , ere I go ; My ear should catch your voice , my eye your eye , My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody . Were the world mine , Demetrius being bated , The rest I'd give to be to you translated . O ! teach me how you look , and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart . I frown upon him , yet he loves me still . O ! that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill . I give him curses , yet he gives me love . O ! that my prayers could such affection move . The more I hate , the more he follows me . The more I love , the more he hateth me . His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine . None , but your beauty : would that fault were mine ! Take comfort : he no more shall see my face ; Lysander and myself will fly this place . Before the time I did Lysander see , Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me : O ! then , what graces in my love do dwell , That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell . Helen , to you our minds we will unfold . To-morrow night , when Ph be doth behold Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass , Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass , A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal , Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal . And in the wood , where often you and I Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie , Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet , There my Lysander and myself shall meet ; And thence from Athens turn away our eyes , To seek new friends and stranger companies . Farewell , sweet playfellow : pray thou for us ; And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius ! Keep word , Lysander : we must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight . I will , my Hermia . Helena , adieu : As you on him , Demetrius dote on you ! How happy some o'er other some can be ! Through Athens I am thought as fair as she ; But what of that ? Demetrius thinks not so ; He will not know what all but he do know ; And as he errs , doting on Hermia's eyes , So I , admiring of his qualities . Things base and vile , holding no quantity , Love can transpose to form and dignity . Love looks not with the eyes , but with the mind , And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind . Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste ; Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste : And therefore is Love said to be a child , Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd . As waggish boys in game themselves forswear , So the boy Love is perjur'd every where ; For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne , He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine ; And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt , So he dissolv'd , and showers of oaths did melt . I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight : Then to the wood will he to-morrow night Pursue her ; and for this intelligence If I have thanks , it is a dear expense : But herein mean I to enrich my pain , To have his sight thither and back again . Is all our company here ? You were best to call them generally , man by man , according to the scrip . Here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all Athens , to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at night . First , good Peter Quince , say what the play treats on ; then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point . Marry , our play is , The most lamentable comedy , and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby . A very good piece of work , I assure you , and a merry . Now , good Peter Quince , call forth your actors by the scroll . Masters , spread yourselves . Answer as I call you . Nick Bottom , the weaver . Ready . Name what part I am for , and proceed . You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus . What is Pyramus ? a lover , or a tyrant ? A lover , that kills himself most gallantly for love . That will ask some tears in the true performing of it : if I do it , let the audience look to their eyes ; I will move storms , I will condole in some measure . To the rest : yet my chief humour is for a tyrant . I could play Ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in , to make all split . The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates : And Phibbus' car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates . This was lofty ! Now name the rest of the players . This is Ercles' vein , a tyrant's vein ; a lover is more condoling . Francis Flute , the bellows-mender . Here , Peter Quince . You must take Thisby on you . What is Thisby ? a wandering knight ? It is the lady that Pyramus must love . Nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; I have a beard coming . That's all one : you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will . An I may hide my face , let me play Thisby too . I'll speak in a monstrous little voice , 'Thisne , Thisne !' 'Ah , Pyramus , my lover dear ; thy Thisby dear , and lady dear !' No , no ; you must play Pyramus ; and Flute , you Thisby . Well , proceed . Robin Starveling , the tailor . Here , Peter Quince . Robin Starveling , you must play Thisby's mother . Tom Snout , the tinker . Here , Peter Quince . You , Pyramus's father ; myself , Thisby's father ; Snug , the joiner , you the lion's part : and , I hope , here is a play fitted . Have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for I am slow of study . You may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . Let me play the lion too . I will roar , that I will do any man's heart good to hear me ; I will roar , that I will make the duke say , 'Let him roar again , let him roar again .' An you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were enough to hang us all . That would hang us , every mother's son . I grant you , friends , if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us ; but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove ; I will roar you as 'twere any nightingale . You can play no part but Pyramus ; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man ; a proper man , as one shall see in a summer's day ; a most lovely , gentleman-like man ; therefore , you must needs play Pyramus . Well , I will undertake it . What beard were I best to play it in ? Why , what you will . I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your French-crown colour beard , your perfect yellow . Some of your French crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . But masters , here are your parts ; and I am to entreat you , request you , and desire you , to con them by to-morrow night , and meet me in the palace wood , a mile without the town , by moonlight : there will we rehearse ; for if we meet in the city , we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known . In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants . I pray you , fail me not . We will meet ; and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously . Take pains ; be perfect ; adieu . At the duke's oak we meet . Enough ; hold , or cut bow-strings . How now , spirit ! whither wander you ? Over hill , over dale , Thorough bush , thorough brier , Over park , over pale , Thorough flood , thorough fire , I do wander every where , Swifter than the moone's sphere ; And I serve the fairy queen , To dew her orbs upon the green : The cowslips tall her pensioners be ; In their gold coats spots you see ; Those be rubies , fairy favours , In their freckles live their savours : I must go seek some dew-drops here , And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear . Farewell , thou lob of spirits : I'll be gone ; Our queen and all her elves come here anon . The king doth keep his revels here to-night . Take heed the queen come not within his sight ; For Oberon is passing fell and wrath , Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy , stol'n from an Indian king ; She never had so sweet a changeling ; And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train , to trace the forests wild ; But she , perforce , withholds the loved boy , Crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy . And now they never meet in grove , or green , By fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , But they do square ; that all their elves , for fear , Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there . Either I mistake your shape and making quite , Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow : are you not he That frights the maidens of the villagery ; Skim milk , and sometimes labour in the quern , And bootless make the breathless housewife churn ; And sometime make the drink to bear no barm ; Mislead night-wanderers , laughing at their harm ? Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck , You do their work , and they shall have good luck : Are you not he ? Fairy , thou speak'st aright ; I am that merry wanderer of the night . I jest to Oberon , and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , Neighing in likeness of a filly foal : And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl , In very likeness of a roasted crab ; And , when she drinks , against her lips I bob And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale . The wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; Then slip I from her bum , down topples she , And 'tailor' cries , and falls into a cough ; And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff ; And waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there . But , room , fairy ! here comes Oberon . And here my mistress . Would that he were gone ! Ill met by moonlight , proud Titania . What ! jealous Oberon . Fairies , skip hence : I have forsworn his bed and company . Tarry , rash wanton ! am not I thy lord ? Then , I must be thy lady ; but I know When thou hast stol'n away from fairy land , And in the shape of Corin sat all day , Playing on pipes of corn , and versing love To amorous Phillida . Why art thou here , Come from the furthest steppe of India ? But that , forsooth , the bouncing Amazon , Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love , To Theseus must be wedded , and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity . How canst thou thus for shame , Titania , Glance at my credit with Hippolyta , Knowing I know thy love to Theseus ? Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna , whom he ravished ? And make him with fair gle break his faith , With Ariadne , and Antiopa ? These are the forgeries of jealousy : And never , since the middle summer's spring , Met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , By paved fountain , or by rushy brook , Or in the beached margent of the sea , To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport . Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents : The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : The fold stands empty in the drowned field , And crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud , And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable : The human mortals want their winter here : No night is now with hymn or carol blest : Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound : And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose , And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is , as in mockery , set . The spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter , change Their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which . And this same progeny of evil comes From our debate , from our dissension : We are their parents and original . Do you amend it then ; it lies in you . Why should Titania cross her Oberon ? I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman . Set your heart at rest ; The fairy land buys not the child of me . His mother was a votaress of my order : And , in the spiced Indian air , by night , Full often hath she gossip'd by my side , And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands , Marking the embarked traders on the flood ; When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind ; Which she , with pretty and with swimming gait Following ,her womb then rich with my young squire , Would imitate , and sail upon the land , To fetch me trifles , and return again , As from a voyage , rich with merchandise . But she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; And for her sake I do rear up her boy , And for her sake I will not part with him . How long within this wood intend you stay ? Perchance , till after Theseus' weddingday . If you will patiently dance in our round , And see our moonlight revels , go with us ; If not , shun me , and I will spare your haunts . Give me that boy , and I will go with thee . Not for thy fairy kingdom . Fairies , away ! We shall chide downright , if I longer stay . Well , go thy way : thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury . My gentle Puck , come hither . Thou remember'st Since once I sat upon a promontory , And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath , That the rude sea grew civil at her song , And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid's music . I remember . That very time I saw , but thou couldst not , Flying between the cold moon and the earth , Cupid all arm'd : a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west , And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow , As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts ; But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon , And the imperial votaress passed on , In maiden meditation , fancy-free . Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell : It fell upon a little western flower , Before milk-white , now purple with love's wound , And maidens call it , Love-in-idleness . Fetch me that flower ; the herb I show'd thee once : The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees . Fetch me this herb ; and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league . I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes . Having once this juice I'll watch Titania when she is asleep , And drop the liquor of it in her eyes : The next thing then she waking looks upon , Be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , On meddling monkey , or on busy ape , She shall pursue it with the soul of love : And ere I take this charm off from her sight , As I can take it with another herb , I'll make her render up her page to me . But who comes here ? I am invisible , And I will overhear their conference . I love thee not , therefore pursue me not . Where is Lysander and fair Hermia ? The one I'll slay , the other slayeth me . Thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood ; And here am I , and wood within this wood , Because I cannot meet my Hermia . Hence ! get thee gone , and follow me no more . You draw me , you hard-hearted adamant : But yet you draw not iron , for my heart Is true as steel : leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you . Do I entice you ? Do I speak you fair ? Or , rather , do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you ? And even for that do I love you the more . I am your spaniel ; and , Demetrius , The more you beat me , I will fawn on you : Use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me ; only give me leave , Unworthy as I am , to follow you . What worser place can I beg in your love , And yet a place of high respect with me , Than to be used as you use your dog ? Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit , For I am sick when I do look on you . And I am sick when I look not on you . You do impeach your modesty too much , To leave the city , and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not ; To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity . Your virtue is my privilege : for that It is not night when I do see your face , Therefore I think I am not in the night ; Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , For you in my respect are all the world : Then how can it be said I am alone , When all the world is here to look on me ? I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts . The wildest hath not such a heart as you . Run when you will , the story shall be chang'd ; Apollo flies , and Daphne holds the chase ; The dove pursues the griffin ; the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger : bootless speed , When cowardice pursues and valour flies . I will not stay thy questions : let me go ; Or , if thou follow me , do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood . Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field , You do me mischief . Fie , Demetrius ! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex . We cannot fight for love , as men may do ; We should be woo'd and were not made to woo . I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , To die upon the hand I love so well . Fare thee well , nymph : ere he do leave this grove , Thou shalt fly him , and he shall seek thy love . Hast thou the flower there ? Welcome , wanderer . Ay , there it is . I pray thee , give it me . I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows , Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine , With sweet musk-roses , and with eglantine : There sleeps Titania some time of the night , Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight ; And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin , Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in : And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes , And make her full of hateful fantasies . Take thou some of it , and seek through this grove : A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth : anoint his eyes ; But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady . Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on . Effect it with some care , that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love . And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow . Fear not , my lord , your servant shall do so . Come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; Then , for the third of a minute , hence ; Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds , Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , To make my small elves coats , and some keep back The clamorous owl , that nightly hoots , and wonders At our quaint spirits . Sing me now asleep ; Then to your offices , and let me rest . The Fairies sing .
