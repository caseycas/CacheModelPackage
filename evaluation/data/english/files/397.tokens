His eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky theyd glare at my noise growing red and raising up his rage I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldnt watch dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling Oh hed not care about the Pedersen kid Hed not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain That would make him mad enough if he was sober I didnt hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen He was all shoveled up like I thought hed be I pushed at his shoulder calling his name I think his name stopped the snoring but he didnt move except to roll a little when I shoved him The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but his face was turned to the wall there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster and I thought Well you dont look much like a pigdrunk bully now I couldnt be sure he was still asleep He was a cagey sonofabitch I shook him a little harder and made some noise Pappappaphey I said I was leaning too far over I knew better He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him Oh he was smart It put you off I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mothernaked in all that dough When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck watering my eyes and I backed off to cough Pa was on his side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow Get the hell out of here I didnt say anything trying to get my throat clear but I watched him He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear It was better though hed hit me He was bitter when he missed Get the hell out of here Big Hans sent me He told me to wake you A fat hell on Big Hans Get out of here He found the Pedersen kid by the crib Get the hell out Pa pulled at the covers He was tasting his mouth The kids froze good Hans is rubbing him with snow Hes got him in the kitchen Pedersen No Pa Its the Pedersen kid The kid Nothing to steal from the crib Not stealing Pa He was just lying there Hans found him froze Thats where he was when Hans found him Pa laughed I aint hid nothing in the crib You dont understand Pa The Pedersen kid The kid I goddamn well understand Pa had his head up glaring his teeth gnawing at the place where hed grown a mustache once I goddamn well understand You know I dont want to see Pedersen That cock Why should I What did he come for hey God dammit get And dont come back Find out something Youre a fool Both you and Hans Pedersen That cock Dont come back Out Out He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow He had long black hairs on his wrist They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt Big Hans made me come Big Hans said A fat hell on Big Hans Hes an even bigger fool than you are Fat hey I taught him dammit and Ill teach you Out You want me to drop my pot He was about to get up so I got out slamming the door He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep Then he threw things Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister Pad been shitsick in that pot Hans got an axe He didnt even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pas door down before he stopped He might not have gone that far if Pa hadnt been locked in laughing fit to shake the house That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it I always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs Hans had laid steaming towels over the kids chest and stomach He was rubbing snow on the kids legs and feet Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough was turning pasty sticking to the kids back and behind Aint he going to wake up What about your pa He was awake when I left Whatd he say Did you get the whisky He said a fat hell on Big Hans Dont be smart Did you ask him about the whisky Yeah Well He said a fat hell on Big Hans Dont be smart Whats he going to do Go back to sleep most likely Youd best get that whisky You go Take the axe Pas scared to hell of axes Listen to me Jorge Ive had enough to your sassing This kids froze bad If I dont get some whisky down him he might die You want the kid to die Do you Well get your pa and get that whisky Pa dont care about the kid Jorge Well he dont He dont care at all and I dont care to get my head busted neither He dont care and I dont care to have his shit flung on me He dont care about anybody All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face Get pigdrunk thats what he wants He dont care about nothing else at all Nothing Not Pedersens kid neither That cock Not the kid neither Ill get the spirits Ma said Id wound Big Hans up tight I was ready to jump but when Ma said shed get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off Not any more Not for years The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where hed cut her with a boot cleat and maybe she saw him heaving it again the dirty sock popping out as it flew It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pas yellow sick insides No you wont Big Hans said Yes Hans if theyre needed Ma said Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her If we had then one of us would have had to go instead Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed Ill get more snow I said I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch I dont know where Ma went I thought shed gone upstairs and expected to hear she had She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said shed go and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat Oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm He was awful angry because hed thought Ma was going to do something big something heroic even especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasnt thinking about that at all not anything like that There was no way of getting even It wasnt like getting cheated at the fair They were always trying so you got to expect it Now Hans had given Ma something of his we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa something valuable but since she didnt know wed given it to her there was no easy way of getting it back Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what shed done Ma had found one of Pas hiding places Shed found one and she hadnt said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one Pa had a knack for hiding He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it But now Ma Shed found it by luck most likely but she hadnt said anything and we didnt know how long ago itd been or how many other ones shed found saying nothing Pa was sure to find out Sometimes he didnt seem to because he hid them so well he couldnt find them himself or because he looked and didnt find anything and figured he hadnt hid one after all or had drunk it up But hed find out about this one because we were using it A fool could see what was going on If he found out Ma found it thatd be bad He took pride in his hiding It was all the pride he had I guess fooling Hans and me took doing But he didnt figure Ma for much He didnt figure her at all and if he found out a woman itd be bad Hans poured some in a tumbler You going to put more towels on him No Why not Thats what he needs something warm to his skin dont he Not where hes froze good Heats bad for frostbite Thats why I only put towels on his chest and belly Hes got to thaw slow You ought to know that Colors on the towels had run Ma poked her toe in the kids clothes What are we going to do with these Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kids mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin Here help me prop him up I got hold his mouth open I didnt want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kids clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didnt make any move to Come on Jorge All right Lift dont shove lift OK Im lifting I took him by the shoulders His head flopped back His mouth fell open The skin on his neck was tight He was cold all right Hold his head up Hell choke His mouth is open His throats shut Hell choke Hell choke anyway Hold his head up I cant Dont hold him like that Put your arms around him Well Jesus He was cold all right I put my arm carefully around him Hans had his fingers in the kids mouth Now hell choke for sure Shut up Just hold him like I told you He was cold all right and wet I had my arm behind his back
