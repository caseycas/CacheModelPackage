Over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles Cool air moving slowly through the open or smashedout side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat Moriarty my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced We were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican Moriarty New Mexico Gracias Adios I said exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcelytapped store of smiles with my hosts daughters I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass Then I saw the fathers head slightly turn gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold Autos whizzed past Whiteshirted and conservativelycravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze Suddenly a treble auto horn tootleytoottootled and thumbing hopefully I saw emergent in windshield flash red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension despair the leering face of old Herry Moreeairteeeee he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde Over the rapidlydiminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herrys black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where hidden more delicatelytextured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes Damn his luck I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and Well at least I wouldnt have shouted back a taunt Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching its prewar chrome nearly blinding me It was stopping Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag I heard Sahjunt Yoorick meet Mrs Major J A Roebuck The voice was that of Johnson tail gunner off another crew Squeezing a look between Johnsons fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired Yall drahve I nodded Onleh one thiihng Mrs Roebuck continued Ahm goin nawth tjawn mah husbun in Sante Fe an yall maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce thiim I said that it didnt make any difference to me either as far as I knew How far I knew will shortly become apparent Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs Roebuck wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit 35 mph is still in eefaket I let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the 60 mph which would I hoped overhaul Herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I Mrs Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs Somebody in Sante Fe When Johnson ejaculated Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Cocola Maam Mrs Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh a little younguh than you bawhs Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age Mrs Roebuck thought Johnson was a sweet bawh tlah lahk thet but her Herman was getting to be a man there was no getting around it Just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dackrihs on the vuhranduh Major Roebuck an Ah an Huhmun says May Ah hev one too Just as plite an an cohnfidunt an Ah says Uh coahse you caint but he says Whah nawt you ah hevin

very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would she said lead us to Taos and then Raton and eventshahleh out of New Mexico How lightly her eventshahleh passed into the crannies where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word would echo And reecho Hardly had Mrs Roebuck driven off when a rusty pickup truck father or grandfather of Senor Moriartys Ford sedan came screeching to a dustswirling stop and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window Get in buddies Get in The straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back Johnson unwired the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely looselytaped fragments of glass and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer In back buddy the driver said to me Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low siderack I stepped on the running board it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin The truck was hurtling forward I seized the rack and made a westernstyle flyingmount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag and merely wrecking my camera I was to discover later my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and but this is no medical report I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the trucks similarity to Senor Xs Ford turtle Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all Whatever satisfaction that might offer Something pulled my leg I drew back drawing back my foot for a kick But it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck cabs glassless rear window The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear Wanna beer Hell yes I roared back between dusty lips Did I want a beer Did an anteater want ants Bueno amigo Gracias I hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish but the drivers white teeth flashing at me the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing I wouldnt have known the difference Johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it White teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnsons ear We were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards We were in a field in a tight screeching turn Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down When I fell on my back I saw a vulture hovering Just as I got to my knees there was again the sound of the fence stretching and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously This time no wire came whipping into the truck We were back on the road I regained my squatting position behind the truck cabs rear window Johnsons left hand was pressed against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers Teewah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing That was Teewah I was talking You thought I was a Mexican didnt you buddy I nodded Hell thats all right buddy the Indian I now guessed said Drink your beer Miraculously the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my luckily waterproof watch No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck The beer foamed furiously I drank furiously A long time Emptied the bottle Teeth again flashing back at me the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which amigo appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound I bobbed my head each time it appeared Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into Johnsons quivering ribs A big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning Beyond it the gray road stretched a long long way The car was just about to us its drivers fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in Sante Fe on anything but an old pickup truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue I tossed the bottle High so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the cars steel roof Too high On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash Ayeyahahah The Indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief probably only a fraction of Johnsons the bottle this time went to the Indians lips Another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board a dirt clod anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle We were slowing In the ditch sand was white and softlooking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleaming But Johnson couldnt quickly unwire the truck door and if I escaped he might suffer The car was approaching fast On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket There was no time to pick out a penny I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile There was a blur just under my focus of vision a crash the cars far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center I heard the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me Looking back I saw a grayhaired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number Sssahjunt Johnsons fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab and that selfproclaimed Baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own lips Two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing The Indians arm whipped sidewise there was a flash of amber and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car Brakes shrieked behind us I saw Johnsons bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the cars rear window Drink you son of a bitch I quickly turned around and began to drink But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson
