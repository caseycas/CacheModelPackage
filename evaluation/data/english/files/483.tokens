I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield that Lucille was a husband stealer You cant keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000plus And Ive been told that just about every town no matter what its size has its Lucille Warren Just as it has its Susan Dolan though nobodyd ever bothered to tell me that Susan Dolan thats me They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission I never heard my folks talk about her though They were goodliving religious people and I can truthfully say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren I know they wouldnt have dreamed of saying it in front of me My folks and my faith protected me from things like that And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs Warren I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck I asked him if it was true He gave me a straight honest answer Look Sue baby hed said Much as I love you well a guys a guy and Lucilles willing to to come across Honest kitten thats all it is I dont even like Lucille much I guess it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren But it didnt seem fair My love for Johnnie was young and clean how could I possibly compete with a woman like that who didnt hesitate to use her sex Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line It was a vivid sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff Dad had ordered I wasnt in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the moment I saw Johnnie I knew he was different He wasnt only different he was it He had an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids dont have but that I had sometimes admired in other older men His smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too I could hardly believe such good luck was mine And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him I guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she had set her sights on Johnnie my Johnnie I didnt like it one bit But what could I do A man had to have his release at least thats what the boys used to say in high school and I wasnt providing it for Johnnie Neither was his wife She wouldnt have even if hed asked her But he wouldnt ask her he wasnt the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will And he wouldnt leave her either hed told me that He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy Johnnie loved me and wanted me But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time Against my folks wishes wed been seeing each other for short rides in the truck The rides were tame enough mostly we talked But by the time the first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly in love Yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little Its so crazy I told him once I always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that Somebody with no vices You know And you fall for a lumber jockey Who drinks far too much And smokes too much And I was ticking off the items on my fingers swears too much and goes out with the boys whoever they are too much and who ever goes to church and wont even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold He examined his nails carefully I could walk out the door Dont you dare And never show my face or my truck around here again He still wasnt looking at me You wouldnt Or I could visit Lucille Warren You wouldnt Please You wouldnt He shrugged noncommittally I might And now he was seeing her Hed just admitted it to me I huddled miserably beside him in the truck It was all my doing his seeing her Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love and that was the way I wanted to keep it At first Johnnie hadnt understood how could he not being a religious person like me But then he had said All right kid if thats how you want it thats how itll be But what had I done trying to keep us pure I had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman I had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the Devil So one week later I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10 My very first time I was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren And though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual awareness that Johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other man had ever triggered I wanted him with a terrifying fierceness Astonishingly enough it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness begging this man to make love to me Love me Johnnie I will kitten Outside in the summertime fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us Will you always love me this way Uh huh Always Mmm And I snuggled closer to the man I loved It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced I had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of marriage but I had all the joy that goes with them Johnnie It cant be wrong can it Not really Johnnie rose on one elbow Stop worrying Its never wrong if love is real I took great comfort from his words and smiled to myself in the darkness Infinite peace complete contentment Idiots delight I later discovered I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious upbringing I had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who being thirty brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God my promise to remain pure until I was married I was practically a bride after all There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible Of this I had no doubt Wouldnt Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness Of course he would Hed not only told me so hed proved it It wasnt Johnnies fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable Just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too And if I could contribute to that Id do it The cost didnt matter No price is too high when true love is at stake And I had no doubts about how true this love was Id never even petted with a boy and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the longest while not until I all but threw myself at him He was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman and I figured that emotionally I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half What could a mere twelve years matter It wasnt I was sure a difference in age that came between people but a difference in maturity And hadnt I rescued him from Lucille Warren Shed have gotten him if I hadnt stopped her After all Lucille Warren was a husbandstealer from way back But Id been a good girl and now God was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring Love me Uhhuh Love you Always and always Johnnie Always Mmm Convention time in Boston A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow From the entire eastern half of the nation theyd be coming members of the Young Christians League and Id been chosen to represent our chapter I had mixed emotions about going Id been seeing Johnnie almost a year now but I still didnt want to leave him for five whole days But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group I hadnt been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group So I went to Boston The first meeting was held in Faneuil Hall a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states My cousin Alma at whose home I was staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island One of them was a very friendly lovely fellow named Ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing blue eyes He looked very different from Johnnie in fact he looked sort of like me I thought so and he mentioned it and Alma said so too After the meeting there was going to be a party at someones house I assumed Alma would get me there but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up we were separated Outside the hall I anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a hand on my elbow Hey there beautiful twin of mine Ronald said Need a pumpkin to get to the party I couldnt help laughing with him Well I should find Alma I began Alma Schmalma Come along with me I went By the time we arrived the party was already going strong A couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and I realized they were drinking My folks wouldnt dream of having alcohol in the house so my first taste of it had been of course with Johnnie I hadnt liked it at first it was bitter and burning But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale I enjoyed it Of course I enjoyed most anything if I did it with Johnnie Johnnie I suddenly realized hed been totally out of my thoughts all evening But that was only natural I decided surely he was still resting snugly in my heart I dont see Alma anywhere I said Shes invisible tonight Cmon lets find out where theyre keeping the glasses I drew back I I dont think so Ronald Not for me Aw come on No really He shrugged Okay But at least come along while I get lubricated The kitchen was jammed Strange faces most of them and I wasnt even sure all of them had come from the League meeting
