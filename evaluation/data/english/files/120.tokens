Hotei is 23 feet long with an 812foot beam and every inch a family boat Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5foot 11inch headroom bunks for three galley and marine toilet The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit All are well distributed not crowded together near the stern And with passenger weight shifted forward Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800 The 80hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard With only two aboard Hotei does better than 27 mph and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a threefoot chop She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser Nor is she a wet boat Weve been out in fivefoot waves and stayed dry A lot of thought went into storage space construction Theres a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis life jackets etc The aft cockpit has a Af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat On each side of the motor well theres storage for battery bumpers line and spare props with sixgallon gas tanks below The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800s or 500s if you wish and theres room for a 25gallon longcruise gas tank below it Needless to say you cant build Hotei in a couple of weeks Our building time was slightly over 400 hours but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom sink head and hardware was under $800 A comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3000 Consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3000 and your building time is well worth it A Gator trailer Model 565 is used to transport the boat to the waterways This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years All framing in Hotei is oneinch mahogany which in the dressed state you buy it is about the 1316inch thickness specified in the drawings Therefore the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens etc on a table saw Besides flathead bronze screws silicon bronze Stronghold nails made by Independent Nail & Packing Co Bridgewater Mass are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor Draw each outline in a differentcolor chalk one on top of the other In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped glued and fastened with oneinch No 12 Stronghold nails After notching it for the keelson chines and battens the halfinch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails All frames are butted at the joints and 38inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint again using the oneinch No 12 nails The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines If notched for the battens they would require more work be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction Be sure all members are parallel vertical and level as required After the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced a piece of threeinchwide mahogany only widths will be given since the 1316inch thickness is used throughout is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson The frames are glued and screwed to this piece The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resinsaturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced The keelson made of two threeinch widths is next installed The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first Note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end Oneinch No 10 screws are used in both cases A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one The stem is laminated from four pieces Take two threeinchwide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member Theyre glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson A number of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets All bottom battens are two inches wide The side ones are a halfinch narrower The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames Glue and 112inch No 10 screws are used Placement is important because the rear seat bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens With the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of twoinch wood for strength and easier bending Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig I clamped a 30inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips The aluminum flush against the battens acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily If you dont own a planer and dont want to buy one its well worth renting The planking is fiveply 38inchthick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood This can be obtained in 42inch widths 24 feet long The 42inch width leaves very little waste Four pieces are used Plank the sides first using glue and oneinch No 12 Stronghold nails at all battens the stem and the transom Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off Then trim the excess I used a Homemaster RoutoJig made by Porter Cable for this job Its good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bitlike blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw When cut the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming Then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames keelson and all the battens It may then be predrilled for the fastenings The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points Then it is replaced and fastened The bottom planking is applied in the same manner After planking the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is roughsanded in preparation Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails they are also roughsanded in that area The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time A 50inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin When the resin has hardened mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish I used bright red mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener Using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth When the cloth is smooth apply another coat of resin spreading it with a paint roller Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden When the whole bottom has hardened use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail Then lay a threeinchwide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem Before the resin has hardened screw a oneinch mahogany keel strip along the centerline This protects the bottom in beaching Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co 1605 W Elizabeth Ave Linden N J They will also supply literature on application The hull is now turned over with the help of about seven friends and placed in a level wellbraced position I set it on the Gator trailer I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also installing a bow eye at this time For added strength I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint Again these blocks were set in resinsaturated glass cloth and nailed After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height the top of the side planking is installed This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry When theyre on the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces The decking is quarterinch mahogany marine plywood All the flooring and the storage bin is halfinch exterior fir plywood Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring The exception is where the flooring butts These battens are glued and screwed to the frames With all deck battens in place the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place After the decking is on the cabin sides are installed Theyre followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin Inside bunks are framed up and installed as indicated A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a fivegallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink For padding the seats and bunks I used Ensolite Type Aj Lightweight nonabsorbent fire resistant and dimensionally stable it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement Available in Af sheets it costs about a dollar a square foot
