He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room The maid answered and he decided Nancy must be at work Jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and then ignoring his own advice said excitedly But it does sound good A woman named Lisa who tells nobody anything about herself That courtyard picture with the same initials Im not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm Ill call you in a day or so On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast Gulf Springs was ten miles inland more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions He checked into a motel and drove downtown The courthouse was a whitestucco building minus the customary dome Instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most smalltown squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably brightgreen shade of florists grass He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff Carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office Seated in front of the desk Hank said Im looking for some information with very little to go on Sheriff He explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to Gulf Springs The sheriffs swivel chair tilted back So youre looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned If there was such a person Im afraid she got away with it Pity we dont know more about him I think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later Itll be a tedious job but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisors office Maybe the society editor would remember a goodlooking outoftown bride Thats an idea Mrs Calhoun has been society editor here for twentyfive years The editor says that marriages may be made in heaven but weddings are made in Mrs Calhouns columns Shes the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that He smiled Once when the editor was just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation Mrs Calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed Shed be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background Shed have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment Shed also remember if the groom died later He stood up I wish you good luck but please dont dig up too tough a case for me this close to election If you find out anything come on back here and well get started on it Tracking down Mrs Calhoun was like trying to catch up with Paul Revere between Lexington and Concord It turned out that she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance The wearying trek stretched into the afternoon from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found her at five oclock She was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter It took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted Last year Well I do remember one From Baton Rouge Married a man named Vincent Black I remember her because she didnt want her picture in the paper First bride like that Ive seen in twentyfive years What reason did she give Said she had a breakingout on her face some sort of allergy and none of her old pictures was good enough I didnt see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked like it had never had a blemish on it But of course you couldnt see too well through the veil Was her name Lisa Carmody Now how in hell would I remember that Never mind I can look it up Do they still live here I think they moved away shortly after they were married He was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred Im sure itll be in the files We usually run a social note when somebody moves away He stood up and thanked her Have they inherited some money or something She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye He said vaguely Well it is a little legal matter but nothing like that He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving Sounds like what youre after he said when Hank had finished Come on lets hurry down before they lock up for the day In the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolledup shirt sleeves Mr Ferrell Hirey Lindsay chairman of the board of supervisors Mr Ferrell is a private detective Hirey Wants to look up something in the newspaper files so dont lock him in here Sure said Hirey Ill just leave the door open It latches when you close it so stay as long as you like Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half He pulled it open Now dont shut this door It wont open from inside Before we built the new jail we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded Hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners They were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from Hireys air conditioner coming through the grille He walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big leatherbound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls A metal table and four chairs stood in the center Theyre all here back to 1865 Carruthers told him Its all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave And of course you know not to take clippings Ill leave the air conditioner on for you Mr Ferrell said Hirey Dont forget to turn it off and close the door good so itll latch Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules When they had gone he stood for a minute breathing in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner couldnt quite dispel Chapter fourteen In a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room An old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him It was indeed all here almost a century From reconstruction to moon rockets But he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones Last years volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf He pulled it over climbed up and lifted out the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it He staggered over and dropped it on the table Since Mrs Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started to plod through several months He tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him At last he found it in the paper of April 2 It told him little more than Mrs Calhoun had remembered stating that it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom Mr Blacks life was an open book so to speak from his birth in Jackson Mississippi through his basketballplaying days at LSU and his attainment of a BA degree which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for Peerless Business Machines The one line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge No mention of New Orleans Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr Black If Mrs Black was who he thought she was Mr Blacks Peerless selling days might well be over Now for their exodus from Gulf Springs This time the search took twice as long cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several columns of one and twoline social notes in each issue He found it in the edition of May 15 The item said Mr and Mrs Black had moved to Jackson his home town so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago Next on his program was a call to the Jackson office of Peerless Business Machines to find out if Vincent Black was still with them or more specifically still with us He glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided to indulge his weakness now For the next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen McKinleys assassination the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago and the HallMills trial In the middle of the stock market crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office He turned around saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse Something else distracted him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence Then he knew it was not sound but lack of it The air conditioner was no longer running He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing It clanged shut as he sprang toward it He pressed his face against the grille Whos there The light shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond enough for him to see there was no one there Then he heard the outer door closing Hey come back he shouted He thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind Unless he was stoneblind the person whod just left couldnt have missed seeing Hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room And even if hed somehow missed seeing him he wouldnt have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted But why To search his room at the motel To come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left No they could kill him just as easy right now Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault Then he heard it and smelled it the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors office Until now Lilac Gaylor and Lila Kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing Except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality Gaylors obsession and Cunninghams chimerachasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking of Lila and Lilac separately or together as a legend They kept drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide
