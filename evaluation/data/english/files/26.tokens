Santa Barbara The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn Beryl W Sprinkel economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank Chicago predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn California group conference Another speaker William H Draper Jr former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper Gaither & Anderson urged the US to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wont be pushed around any more He urged support for President Kennedys requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations not flash in pan Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern In view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neostagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 195960 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery Danger cited He cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 The unsatisfactory 195860 expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike Sacrifices needed Draper declared As I see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today We must justify our heritage We must be ready for any needed sacrifice He said that from his experience of two years with Gen Clay in West Berlin administration that Russia respects our show of strength but that presently were not acting as we should and must He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do While he declined to suggest how he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro for unless we do were liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I dont believe we can permit that New York AP Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery erasing all of Mondays losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hopedfor support level represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages Some good news Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year paving the way for lower taxes The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 719 to 68787 Of 1253 issues traded 695 advanced and 354 declined New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 Trading was

by Peter G Peterson head of one of the worlds greatest camera firms in a key address before the American Marketing Assn However Peterson president of Bell & Howell warned 800 US marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and unconventional wisdom Creations needed As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed Peterson said With this kind of new product logjam the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the shortterm advantage which it often needs Nothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas He cited as an example how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs by improving its production knowhow and technology He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an allautomatic camera in Germany with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market Election

dividends I should Answer Write to the funds custodian bank the First National Bank of Jersey City NJ That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund Fundamental Investors Diversified Investment Fund and TelevisionElectronics Fund The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things But it seems that this electronic brain wasnt programmed correctly This resulted in a great number of errors And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation At that time the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected within 60 days That 60day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds complaining about mistakes in their accounts Maybe its taking longer to get things squared away than the

bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger but could possibly be an ultimate effect The railroad

things weaken us Perlman said Bad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and

since the depression of the 1930s he told the hearing C & O president Walter J Tuohy was summoned back for crossexamination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing
