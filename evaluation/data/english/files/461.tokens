Bastards he would say all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff and the first chair clobbered me Since then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent and even indecent group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero he had become a suckerrolling freightjumper There aint nothin faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace Feathertop would say The accommodations may not be the poshest but man There aint nobody askin for your ticket stub neither He had been conning the freights for a long long time now Ever since the hooch and the trouble with the Quartet and Midge and the child Ever since all that It had been a very long time that had no form and no end He was as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own riding the dark train out Out and out and never to return again Till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped That was the day it ended The freight car was cold early in the morning He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina He held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tunebelly The train slowed at a road crossing and the big door slid open at first gratingly caught by grains of corn then with a clash into its slot The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor She pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and Feathertops music pfffted away Now that is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner A little thing but the right twist for the action that counted Hot that was the word hot Hair like a morningfrightened sparrows wings with the sun shining down over them A poet yet His thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however ZinggggO Then the boy straightarmed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting He was less to see but Feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight Curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummers blocky hands and a body that said well maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes but then Im finished We made it Cappy the chick said Yeah seems so dont it the boy laughed hugging her close Ahah Feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants None of that We run a respectable house here They whirled and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall He was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes He held the black plastic kazoo lightly Come sit said Feathertop motioning them toward him That crap is softer over here The girl smiled and started forward The boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm Now stay with me Kitty he snapped irritably I vowed to take care of you and thats what Im gonna do We dont know this guy Oooo square bit Feathertop screwed his face up This guy was strictly from Outsville But nowhere What is with this vow jazz Feathertop inquired lounging against the freights vibrating wall We we eloped Cappy said His head came up and he said it defiantly Well congratulations Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand These two were going to be easy pickins They couldnt have much dough but then none of the freightbums Feathertop rolled had much And besides the chick had a little something the others didnt have That was gonna be fun collecting But not just yet Feathertop was a connoisseur He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it Come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings Im just a poor exjazz man name of uh Boyd Smith He grinned at them wolfishly That aint your name Mister the boy accused And you know youre right Feathertop aimed a finger at him Oh come on Cappy the girl chided Hes okay Hes a nice guy She started to move toward the hay bags dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle He cleared his throat it had been a long hot while since hed seen anything as nice as this within grabbin distance He had it all doped of course Slug the kid grab his dough at least enough to get to Philadelphia and then have a rockin ball with the doll Hmm diddle Whered you come from Mr uh Mr Smith Kitty inquired politely Where from He mused Out I been riding train for a ways now They lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself After a while Kitty murmured something to Cappy and he held her close answering Well just have to wait till we pull into Philly honey Whats the matter she wanna go the bathroom Ernie found it immensely funny The boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked No Certainly not I mean no that isnt what I said She snapped at him I only said I was hungry We havent had anything to eat all day Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargills voice as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with leather handles Whynt ya say so fellow travelers Why we got dinner right here Cmon buddy help me set up the kitchen and well have food in a minute or two Cappy looked wary but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty exmusician to the center of the refuselittered boxcar Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book of matches and a wrinkled and manytimes folded piece of tin foil with holes in it He put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot A charcoal pit man he said indicating the slightlysmoking makeshift brazier Fan it he told Cappy handing him a sheet of newspaper Yeah but whatre we gonna eat Charcoal Fella Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man you try my everlovin patience He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners Hot dogs man Not the greatest but they stick to your belly insides He ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil Almost immediately they began to sizzle He looked up and grinned A Krogers selfserve he explained I selfserved When they had licked the last of the wieners taste from their fingers they settled back and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette Nice kid Ernie thought too bad How come youre riding the rods kids like you Ernie asked Cappy looked down at his wide hands and did not reply But surprisingly Kittys face came up and she said My father He didnt want us to get married So we ran away Why didnt he want you to get hitched This time even she did not answer She looked down at her hands too After a few seconds she said Dad didnt like Cappy It was my fault Cappys head came around sharply Your fault hell It was all my fault If Id been careful it never woulda he stopped abruptly Ernies eyebrows went up Whats the matter The girl still did not raise her eyes but she added simply Im pregnant Cappy raged at himself Oh he was stupid her old man You never heard nothin like it Kittys gonna go have an abortion and Kittys gonna go away to a convent and Kittys this and Kittys that like he was nuts or somethin yknow Ernie nodded This was a slightly different matter He remembered Midge and the child But that had been a time before all this a time he didnt think about A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out But these kids werent like him Oh crap He thought Pull out of it old son These are just another couple of characters to roll What they got you get Now forget all this other Wanna drink Ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket Yeah Now that you offer The answer came from the open door of the boxcar From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade Ernie stared at the man He was big Real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like a grizzly Road gang Ernie thought You gonna give me a drink fella The big man asked again taking a step into the boxcar Ernie hesitated a moment This character could break him in half Sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips He guzzled down threequarters of the strong homeblend and proffered the remainder The man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring He took the bottle with undue belligerence and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely He threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously He belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door Well now he said and reached into his pocket I didnt know I was gonna have company in this car Were going to Philadelphia Kitty said pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more No I dont think so said the big man and it was the final clincher for Ernie He had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it Maybe you and me will girlie but these two aint goin nowhere He advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car Ernie was screaming inside himself No damn you you aint gonna take my meal ticket away from me The newcomer stalked toward them and Kitty shied back her hand to her mouth Her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied by the rattling of the freight and then Cappy came off the floor his legs driving him hard The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump And carried him backward in a footballers tackle They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs The kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back The fist went down into the pile of flesh and Ernie heard the bigger mans deeper voice go Aaawww Then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade He held the knife aloft an instant an instant enough to press the stud The blade came out with a snick He fisted the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kids throat Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white She grabbed at Feathertops sleeve and shrieked Help him Help him Do something
