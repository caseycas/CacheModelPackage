The safe at Ingleside District Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain Harriss office to the left the lieutenants office farther along and to the left and the janitors supply closet straight ahead The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred and fifty unused lefthand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold Policemens Ball tickets from last year and thirtyseven cents in coins and stamps Gun set the captains fifth of Hiram Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt Killpath though he knew that Killpaths ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman Wolffs gift It was more a matter of tact and also it was none of Killpaths goddam business He walked up to the lieutenants office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy Range He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumedoak desk stuffing envelopes Wheres the Lieut The clerk wagged his head toward the captains office Gun went to the connecting door which was open and stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair The lieutenants sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded and as Killpath raked the comb through it it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull The lieutenant eyed Guns reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his head Leave me alone Gun thought Fight with Sam Schaeffer fight with the whole damned Bureau But leave me alone Because Im looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man and Im going to get him If you just leave me to hell alone Lieutenant Killpath peered through halfclosed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and aboutfaced Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window He sat stiffbacked in a chair that did not swivel though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair The desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons Killpath pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut It was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer He put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant Gun waited The 745 bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut closing in the assembled day watch Finally Orville intoned through his hawk nose We cant have people running in any time they please Sergeant No sir Running in running out Cant have it Makes for confusion and congestion He rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach his beady eyes fixed on Matson He was silent again possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom Roll was being called Gun cleared his throat Killpath said You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago Sergeant Thats not getting all the juice out of the orange now is it No sir Then Killpath smiled Gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time The daywatch platoon commander Lt Rinker was calling out the beat assignments but Matson couldnt make the names mean anything I called the station at three this morning Killpaths nasal voice pronounced Do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time Sergeant Vaughn sir Now now youre just guessing Sergeant He smiled thinly savoring his joke What if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen Sir Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief He must have He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper Now thats not regulation is it No sir But you didnt know a thing about it did you Killpath leaned forward his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again frowning now Thats not taking ones command with a responsible attitude Matson Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank I was out in the district sir Oh yes So I have heard He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped He took up a white sheet of paper dark with singlespaced data A car pulled into the driveway outside the window Gun knew it was Car 12 the wagon returned from delivering Inglesides drunkanddisorderlies to the City Jail But for some fool reason he couldnt remember which men hed put on the transfer detail He stared at the report in Killpaths hand sure it was written by Accacia just as sure as if hed submitted it in his scrawled longhand He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again wound the goldwire stems of his glasses around his ears and then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the stations activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspectors Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O T Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as afterhours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six he leaned back and peeled off his glasses failed to cooperate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered What have you to say to that Sergeant Killpath sailed the paper across the desk but Matson didnt pick it up or even glance at it Well I didnt think Accacia knew so many big words Lieutenant Killpath licked his lips Patrolman Accacia is an alert and conscientious lawenforcement officer I dont think his diligence mitigates your negligence Matson Negligence hell Gun held his breath a moment pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat Sir I would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot if Id sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district Its too bad I didnt call you and its too bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when he could have had a boy whod be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure But Im not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around and Lets not push our patience beyond the danger line Sergeant Killpath nasaled I shouldnt like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty Gun stiffened his hands balling into fists at his sides He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out An argument with Orville Torrence Killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range Killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee Lets just remember Sergeant that we must all carry our own umbrella A district station cant run smoothly unless He interrupted himself looking around Gun at the doorway Morning Lieutenant Rinker Sorry Orville I thought you hadnt come in yet Ive been here for some time He stood up cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly The sergeant is just leaving It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers didnt work that Loren Severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpaths office Now as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping to hear the daywatch playback of his chewing out Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about Killpaths little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders He just didnt want to talk about it If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour because hed be damned if he was going to be a midwatch pencilpusher just to please his ulcerated protem captain At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes remembering then that hed left them at the Doughnuttery He could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going home But even before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station he knew that he wasnt going home Not yet It was nine oclock in the morning the hour which like a spade turning clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night Mission Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty the neighborhood that had known Urbano Quintana by day Then Sol Phillips had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart seventeen years ago It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foothigh letters across each of the two display windows On the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was Gonzalez Prop and under that Se Habla Espanol Mr Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez Prop but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome Language was no problem anyway Mr Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission Street Aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising Mr Phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to Gun Matson who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a JiffyCouchaBed mauve velour $7989 nothingdown special Shes honest as the day Mr Phillips said and added Mr Gunnar I can say this to you Beebe is a little too honest You cant tell a customer how much its going to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down A time plan is a mere convenience you understand and when He interrupted himself smiling I put her in lamps That way I dont lose so much Why dont you just hire somebody else
