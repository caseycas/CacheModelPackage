A gyrostabilized platform system using restrained gyros is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyroplatformservo combination The restrained gyrostabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows Af where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro The platform angle **yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling This is normally termed the gyro input axis 90degrees away from the gyro output or **yj axis The gyro angular momentum is defined by H Thus if the gyro and platformcontroller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes In the system shown in Fig 71 the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro outputaxis torquer This torque causes the entire system to rotate about the **yf axis since the response to Af If the polarities are correct the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero As the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases Finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in Fig 72 The platform is initially off level by the angle Aj The angle generated by the platform servo **yf multiplied by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer Af is the scale factor of the accelerometer Af The voltage Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af Finally the gyrostabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af The system as indicated in Fig 72 is fundamental and simple because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected With these factors included an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations In this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time When the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain In addition the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain ie high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations This problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time It must be noticed in Fig 71 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af In practice the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe When the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around the vehicle etc One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of highlevel acceleration noise One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include lowpass filters This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt Since a lower loop gain and lowpass filtering increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a nonlinear amplifier for Af The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level Below this level the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering The effect is that the platform returns from an offlevel position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process When the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system amplifier Af The platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified by Af will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift The amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system 73 Practical leveling considerations The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyrostabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros The system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits However the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform This leveling system will hold the platform onlevel automatically as long as the system is actuated A useful byproduct of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level The leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment The process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero The turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above In brief the human replaces amplifier Af in Figs 71 and 72 Manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs If high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs this also minimizes the noise problem With integration the effect of a small acceleration or small platform tilt angle can be seen after a time However skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy Also it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach Manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time The operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random 74 Platform heading Platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator In simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction For purely inertial navigators two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish the heading 75 External determination of heading surveying technique With the gyrostabilized platform leveled it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure Before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined A mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit Transit A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques With the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned The sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer mirror When the platform is aligned the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs The images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers Although this technique is simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist the direction of true north must be known for each launch point However this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days work In many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight With this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment If the platform is not too high off the ground a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform Obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand Autocollimator The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the Zgyro torquer If the polarity is correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the Zaxis gyro If the Z gyro is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift If the drift error is systematic it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current Electrical pickoffs It is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform Essentially the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero 76 Gyrocompass heading Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading For the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the eastwest direction at the base point and the Y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the northsouth direction at the base point The accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform Thus if one accelerometer is properly aligned the other is also The input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers Figure 73 shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above The platform is leveled and properly headed so that the Xgyro input axis is parallel to the eastwest direction and the Ygyro input axis is parallel to the northsouth direction The input axis of the X gyro when pointing in the eastwest direction is always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth If the platform is not properly headed the Xgyro input axis will see a component of the earths rotation The sensing of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading In Fig 74 the input axis of the threeaxis platform is shown at some point on the earth The point is at a latitude **yl and the platform is at an error in heading east The earth is spinning at an angular velocity **zq equal to one revolution per 24 hr When the platform is level **ye is a rotation about the Z axis of the platform Af Since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyrostabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating with respect to the earth
