Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner He was well rid of her He certainly didnt want a wife who was fickle as Ann If he had married her hed have been asking for trouble But all of this was rationalization Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann and then could not get back to sleep His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldnt allow it The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work He found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann each day the hurt was a little duller a little less poignant He had plenty of work to do Because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years The grass in the meadows came fast now that the warm weather was here He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows He had no idea how much time Budd would give him In any case he had no intention of being caught asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm When in late afternoon on the last day in June he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up No one walked in this country least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew Morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever He cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his Winchester and started downstream His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet Reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his Winchester in his hands They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty They were dirty their clothes were torn and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door She lay there making no effort to get back on her feet The boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring Morgan hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one He didnt think it was possible for this couple to be pretending The boy licked his dry lips He asked Could we have a drink Morgan jerked his head toward the front door In the kitchen he said Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl Get up Theres water in the house She didnt move or say anything Her eyes were glazed as if she didnt hear or even see him She had reached a point at which she didnt even care how she looked Her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new skin under it red and angry Her blond hair was frowzy her dress torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection It must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding He picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house She was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms that he wasnt even sure she was conscious Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him Besides she had a sweet face that attracted him He put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table They looked a good deal alike Morgan thought Both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity of features Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girls head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth She drank greedily and murmured Thank you as he lowered her head He stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced her to this condition He had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two The girl dropped off to sleep Morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy Who are you and what happened to you He asked Im Billy Jones the boy answered Thats my wife Sharon We ran out of money and we havent eaten for two days What are you doing here Are we in Wyoming Morgan nodded About five miles north of the line Jones sighed as if relieved Weve been looking for work but all the ranchers have turned us down You mean you dragged your wife all over hells halfacre looking for work Morgan demanded The town of Buckhorns only about six miles from here Why didnt you go there We didnt want town work Jones said This is a mighty empty country Morgan said Theres only one more ranch three miles north of here Youd have starved to death if youd missed both places Then were lucky we got here Could you give us a job Mr Morgan Dan Morgan He was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but he knew nothing about the couple They might kill him in his sleep thinking there was money in the house He dismissed the possibility at once The girls thin face haunted him It wasnt the face of a killer He wasnt so sure about the boy He hadnt shaved for several weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression There was more to this than Jones had told him They were running from something Hed be an idiot to let them stay he thought but he couldnt send them on either I could use some help Morgan said finally but I cant afford to pay you anything I guess youd better go on in the morning Well work for our keep the boy said eagerly Ive been mucking in a mine in the San Juan but I used to work on a ranch Sharon shes cooked in a restaurant Well work hard Mr Morgan Ill see Morgan said Right now you need a meal and a bath Your wifes in terrible shape I know Jones said dejectedly Morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table When the meal was ready he told Jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl He said Ive got some supper ready She rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair Im a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed Who are you How did we get here Im Dan Morgan This is the Rafter Aj You fell down in front of the house and I carried you in I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep Oh She stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said then she murmured Youre very kind Mr Morgan Do you take in all the strays who come by I dont have many strays coming to my front door he said Think you can walk to the table Of course She got to her feet staggered and almost fell He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen She sat down at the table shaking her head Im sorry Mr Morgan Im usually a very strong woman but Im awfully tired And hungry he said Start in Its not much of a meal but its what I eat Not much of a meal The girl cried Mr Morgan its the bestlooking food I ever saw He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much When they were finally satisfied Jones said I think hes going to give us work The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself When he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldnt send them on She said I guess the Lord looks out for fools drunkards and innocents Morgan laughed Which are you Were not drunkards she said Thats all Im sure of She helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall He said Youll feel a lot better after you have a bath Your feet are in bad shape Mrs Jones Youll have to go to town to see the doc No shell be all right Jones said quickly I mean we dont have any way to get there and we cant expect you to quit work just to take us to town Well see Morgan said Could you find me a needle and thread The girl asked My dress needs some work on it He nodded and going into the bedroom brought a needle thread and scissors He said Im going to bed He nodded at the door in front of him Thats my spare bedroom The bed isnt made but youll find plenty of blankets there Youre awfully kind the girl said Well pay you back if youll let us Some way Its all right he said I get up early Youd better sleep Jones followed him into the front room closing the door behind him He said If its all right with you Mr Morgan Ill sleep out here on the couch We havent slept together since we started I just cant take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping together He stopped embarrassed and Morgan said I understand that but I dont savvy why youd go off and leave your jobs in the first place We got fired Jones said We had to do something They were a pair of lost whipped kids Morgan thought as he went to bed
