Andy did not see the newspapers the next day Someone on his staff he suspected it was Ed Thornburg intercepted them and for this Andy was grateful He finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used and didnt awaken until early afternoon Memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also and those who had kidnapped him But where It was still a very big world despite all the modern cant to the contrary Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door He was dozing perhaps the only sleep hed gotten He snapped to alertness at Andys entrance Sorry Mr Paxton Nothing new Lot of people waiting to see you though Reporters Our own people Questions about the show tonight Hub picked up the telephone Shall I let them know youre awake I suppose Hows Lissa do you know Hub considered Some better Shes got plenty of guts Mr Paxton You want me to call her She expecting me to Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted He could not manage the former or expect the latter they had nothing to give to each other The omission might look peculiar to outsiders but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances He had little time to himself anyway As the afternoon sped toward evening the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out each with his own special problem Thornburg arrived with the writers They had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations What remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified as befitting the tragic circumstances Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed Cradle Song in case it was needed Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement they decided it was wise and later to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casinos open date And once Bake slipped in pale and drawn last nights liquor still on his breath with some of todays added to it He asked if there was anything he could do Andy invented a job to keep him busy sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements But from Rocco Vecchio they heard nothing At last it was time to depart Hub nosing about spotted reporters in the lobby so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotels service entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub El Dorado was surrounded by a mob They overflowed the parking lot making progress by automobile difficult Long before he reached the protection of the stage door Andy was recognized Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire They surged around him fingers pointing eyes prying It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last nights heroworshippers They had come not to admire but to observe Its worse inside Thornburg informed Andy Skolmans jammed in every table he could find Under the heading of its an ill wind et cetera Backstage was tomblike by contrast Andys coworkers kept their distance awed by the tragedy But in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read Were with you all the way It was signed by everyone in the troupe Andy couldnt help but be touched He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment Bake himself looked better any kind of job was better than brooding Andy told him Bake I wish youd talk to Skolman see if some kind of p a system can be rigged up outside Its just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasnt able to get a table I wouldnt want him to miss the message Ill try Skolman isnt going to like it much though giving away what he should be selling Skolman wasnt the only one who didnt care for Andys scheme A short time later Lieutenant Bonner stomped into the dressing room I got a bone to pick with you Mr Paxton Its those damn loudspeakers Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying What about them Theyre going to louse me up good My men have been here all afternoon setting up for this thing Bonner explained that with the nightclubs cooperation the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield Motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead However it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose I want you to have the speakers taken out Andy sighed Seems like were never going to see eye to eye Lieutenant Didnt they tell you what I wanted the p a system for Sure I know But its such a long shot No longer than yours What do you expect to get tonight anyway You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces Or have a sign on his car that says Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper Andy crumbled the script in his fist I cant stop you from doing what you think is right But dont try to stop me either Someday Bonner said youre going to ask us for help I can hardly wait What you dont understand is that Im asking for it now But Bonner departed still full of ill will He had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination he had to cling to routine tested procedures To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness But admit or not Bonner was helpless The crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist Andys performance was scheduled for eleven oclock He stalled for a halfhour longer hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money Bake and Shirl Winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable location in Los Angeles nor could they secure any clearcut information regarding his efforts Bake cursed The sweaty bastards probably halfway to Peru with our money by now When no one smiled he felt constrained to add Just kidding natch Thornburg popped in to advise Andy Skolmans sending up smoke signals You about ready Whats he complaining about Bake asked Theyre drinking arent they No We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard They act more like a jury than an audience Andy said Well I guess we cant wait any longer Hub you stick by the stage door If Rock shows up during the number or you hear anything give me the signal Shirl Winter said Ill stay on the phone Mr Paxton Theres a couple of callbacks I can work on Youre a sweetheart but leave one line open He may try to phone us Andy passed into the corridor their good lucks Following him It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different as if he really needed it They were right The act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone The result had nothing of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night Heres where luck would normally step in But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge Twentyfour hours had changed him from a performer to a freak Within this framework what followed was strained even macabre Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy The effect was as depressing as a gravestone the applause irresolute and shortlived Yet Andy plowed ahead mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and gradually his listeners warmed to him Their clapping grew more fervent the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for him as a person The worst was yet to come As Andy reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings Rocco Vecchio a perspiring haggard Vecchio was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief He waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction The music died away discordantly He drew a deep breath Ladies and gentlemen in place of my regular closing number tonight Id like to sing something of a different nature for you Ray if you please the Cradle Song He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience Nor could he blame them This particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency Having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone for support Lullaby and goodnight His voice shook For the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest He wondered if the audience would let him finish They did though contemptuous they were still polite But when he was finally through their scorn was made apparent Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped Otherwise the silence was complete As the lights came up Andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit He stumbled offstage My God he muttered My God Hub was there to support him Its okay Mr Paxton The moneys here all of it At this moment all he could think of was what hed been forced to undergo Did you hear them Do you know what they think of me Bunch of damn jerks Hub growled Who needs them Thornburg patted his arm Sure Andy itll be all right Nothing broken that cant be mended The words were hollow Thornburg knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty All the kings horses and all the kings men Vecchio shouldered in I got it Andy God knows how but I got it Youll never believe the places Ive been today I practically had to sign your life away youll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for but Andy nodded dully It doesnt matter Rock Weve done our part He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent the place had the air of a morgue Andy had no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them
