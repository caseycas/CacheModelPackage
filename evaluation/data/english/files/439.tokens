The flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head Tie him up Hell with it Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guards own gun against the uncovered head hard The man went over without sound falling to the bare floor Barton said harshly Why did you do that Rankin sneered at him What did you want me to do kiss him He dumped me in solitary twice Barton caught the lighter mans shoulder and swung him around Lets get one thing straight you and me The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out If you ever try anything without my orders Ill kill you Fred Rankin looked at him It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him the thinlipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now Come on Lets move They filed out through the guardroom door into the paved square There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate but they were in other cell blocks There was no chance They moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall There was no moon They had chosen this night purposely They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above and Powers slipped through the door Two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed They looked up in surprise as Powers came in What are you doing out of the block Its Curtiss he said naming the man Rankin had hit Ive got to have help They stared at him The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet Whats wrong with him Hes having some kind of a fit The sergeant turned to the door As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the mans side One sound and youre dead The sergeant froze Powers had not followed Powers was covering the remaining guard The man halfreached for the cord of the alarm bell Powers knocked his arm aside Deliberately with none of Rankins viciousness he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guards head They were free Even Barton could not quite believe it It had gone without a hitch They slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark ground Five minutes later they reached the horses Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short No one hurried They walked the horses heading along the river Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts Five miles In a small grove against the river they halted turning deep into the protection of the trees Foster had brought extra clothing also A good man Emmett He had been one of the original Night Riders one who had escaped the trial It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dills release from the prison Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt Kid Boyd was unusually silent Rankin watchful a few paces apart Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers I wont even try to thank you The exprison guard was embarrassed He said in a studied voice I didnt do it for you I did it for the valley Youre the only man the Night Riders will follow Weve been starving and I dont like to starve Barton turned away his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse Good luck The murderer lifted his head Meaning you want me to ride out You arent one of us Theres nothing for you here I got no place to go Barton hesitated He did not trust Rankin his violent temper his killer instinct But ten years in prison had taught him realities They were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and money It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to call them Night Riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the other side Your choice he said briefly and turned to Kid Boyd Bury those uniforms so they wont be found Then Barton touched Carl Dills arm and moved off up the river bank He wanted a careful uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over silently He too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months without the solace of tobacco Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly For his first five years in prison they had shared a cell Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicates money He had done time for the theft The one thing they had in common was their hatred Both hated Donald Kruger It had drawn them together and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this nights escape He said now Ive got the perfect headquarters set up The old Haskell mine Mitch Barton knew the place Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley They had spent a million dollars carving in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned The roads washed badly said Dill but theres a trail you can get over with a horse A company of cavalry couldnt come in there if two men were guarding that trail Barton nodded How do the valley people feel As mad as ever But Krugers men keep them off balance and they dont trust me Im an outsider When they learn youre in the hills though theyll rally dont worry about that Barton waited for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind My boy Did you find him Dill was silent as if he hated to answer and Barton had a cold sick feeling of apprehension Hes in Morgans Ferry Barton halfstraightened in surprise Whats he doing there Again Dill hesitated Dealing faro Dealing faro How come Your sisterinlaw has the faro bank in Cap Ayres saloon Barton cursed under his breath After another long pause he asked How many people know who they are Everyone Your cousin Finley saw to that Hes quite a rat you know He sold out to Krugers men Hes informed them of everything youve ever written him He wants your ranch Barton stood up He said tensely All right Lets go get the boy Dill had come up also I was afraid of this I almost didnt tell you If you hadnt Id have killed you Dills voice tightened But you cant ride into the Ferry Thats what theyll expect you to do Theyll be there waiting for you I understand how you feel about the child The hell you do Bartons voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it I never saw him My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away I cant leave him there Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage and I wouldnt entrust a snake to his tender care Ive got to get the boy Lets ride Chapter two Bartons men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult It was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit The office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove The building was dwarfed by the scene outside There a dozen giant monitors played their seventyfivefoot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside The gravel was the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth It was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices A million dollars of gold a month A million tons of rock and soil and brush The monitors ran twentyfour hours each day Their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles Hague like all who worked near the pits was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums He was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt Ten years older than Mitch Barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation He was proud of his accomplishments proud of his job proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him He lived and breathed for the mining company No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke The man was tall thin with a narrow face and a toolarge nose The eyes always held Hague eyes of a dead man lidless as a lizards with the fixed intensity of a cobra Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke He knew nothing about the mans history Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger Kodyke was to head the dread company police He ran the change rooms He threw out the higraders He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype This is Mitchell Barton He broke out of Folsom last night Apparently he bribed one of the guards We want him back there or we want him dead Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully Dangerous Dangerous yes You know how the ranchers in the valley are They blame us for all their troubles Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them We dont want Bartons Night Riders loose again The gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing Normally Hague wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said
