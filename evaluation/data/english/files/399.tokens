But they all said No your time will come Enjoy being a bride while you can There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House where the Albright boys always took their brides till they could get a house and a farm of their own So when the Big House filled up and ran over the sistersinlaw found beds for everyone in their own homes And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do So Linda Kay gave up asking and accepted her reprieve Without saying so she was really grateful for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joes wife She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this People died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway at night Bobby Joe was gone all day now not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper When they first married he had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal Now there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained and she did not know where he went Not that she complained or had any cause to Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age so naturally they ran around together There was no reason for her to ask what they did Thus a new pattern of days began to develop for Granny Albright did not die She lay still on the bed her head hardly denting the pillow sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup They stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next day or two Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home for she might die any time but they might as well unpack their suitcases for she might linger on So the pattern was established When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the Big House There was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was or would be Bobby Joe and the boys would come by say Hows Granny And sit on the porch a while The older men would be there at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town The women and children stayed at the Albrights The women keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night The children had to play away from the house in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn to maintain a proper quietness Off and on all day someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything The evaporative cooler had been moved to Grannys room and her door was kept shut so that the rest of the house stayed open though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way The dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them so that the women were always making ice water They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fiftypound blocks of ice in town as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there One afternoon as the women sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gate It was a Cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled They were an old fat couple as Linda Kay described them to herself a thick middleaged man and a girl about ten or twelve There was much embracing much exclaiming Cousin Ada Cousin John Cousin Lura Cousin Howard And how is she About the same John about the same All the women got up and offered their chairs and when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and their explanations We were on our vacation in Canada Howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming and the news didnt catch up with us till we were nearly home We came on as soon as we could There was the suggestion of ice water and in spite of the protest Were not really thirsty Linda Kay to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices hurried to the kitchen She filled a big pitcher and set it with glasses on a tray Carrying it to the living room she imagined the picture she made tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she entered the room Howard the thick middleaged man was looking at her She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed And who is this He asked when she passed him a glass Oh thats Linda Kay Mama Albright said fondly She married our baby boy Bobby Joe this summer Lets see Cousin Ada said Hes a right smart younger than the rest Oh yes Mama laughed Hes ten years younger than Ernest We didnt expect him to come along thought for the longest he was a tumor This joke was not funny to Linda Kay and she blushed as she always did then hearing the muffled boom of Howards laughter blushed redder Who is Howard anyway She asked Bobby Joe that night He makes me uncomfortable Oh hes a second cousin or something He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money How old is he Gosh I dont know Thirtyfive I guess Hes been married and got this halfgrown kid If he bothers you dont pay him any mind Hes just a big windbag Bobby Joe was thinking about something else Say did you know theyre fixing to have a twoday antelope season on the Double J He was talking about antelope again when they woke up Listen I never had a chance to kill an antelope There never was a season before but now they want to thin em out on account of the drouth Did he ever visit here when he was a kid Linda Kay asked Who Howard Hell I dont know When he was a kid I wasnt around Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door and with a quick Bye now was gone for the day Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac Were going after ice Howard said and thought maybe youd go along and keep us company There was really no reason to refuse and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac Driving along the calichetopped road to town Howard talked Finally he said Tell me about yourself and Linda Kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life She was such a wellrounded teenager having been a twirler Future Farmers sweetheart and secretary of Future Homemakers In her sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe who was a football player Future Homemakers sweetheart and president of Future Farmers It was easy to see that they were made for each other and they knew what they wanted Bobby Joe would be a senior this year and he planned to graduate But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and blushing raise his children Howard sighed You lucky kids he said Id give anything if I could have found a girl like you Then he told Linda Kay about himself Of course he couldnt say much really because of Debora but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got It made her feel different about Howard She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they did was talk about antelope Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home Cook a whole antelope She exclaimed Why I couldnt even cook a piece of antelope steak I never even saw any Oh you could I want to roast the whole thing and have it for the boys Linda Kay told him he couldnt do anything like that with his Grandma dying and he said well they had to eat didnt they they werent all dying Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry but they were going up to the Big House after supper and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albrights and sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze It was fullofthemoon or a little past and nearly light as day They all sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had a good time Once in a while they said what a shame it was with Granny dying but they all agreed she wouldnt have wanted it any other way That night the older men got to talking about going possumhunting on a moonlight night Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possumhunting and Uncle Bill Farnworth from Mama Albrights side of the family said he would just get up from there and take them right then After they had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places to sit There were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall Howard who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting Youll be a darn sight more comfortable there Howard Ernest said laughing and they all laughed Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand from time to time but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers but she had never been so aware of anyones flesh before Still she was not sorry he sat by her but in fact was flattered He had become the center of the company such stories he had to tell He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person he had helped fight an oilwell fire that raged six days and nights
